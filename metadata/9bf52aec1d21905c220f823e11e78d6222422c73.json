Until now, there's been one thing missing: an ultimate, fully-loaded, ridiculously over-packed reference book for every home project you can dream of; the compilation of our longstanding expertise; the home how-to book to crush all others. The good news doesn't stop there; Black &amp; Decker The Book of Home How-To is designed to reflect the way we search for information today. You won't find chapters or long, boring introductions or even a table of contents. This book is an A-to-Z encyclopedia with precise how-to instructions and clear photos packed onto every page. With an expanded index that is incredibly intuitive and a simple, alphabetical strategy for organizing the information, you won't spend precious time wading through stuff you don't need to know. Finding first-rate information on home care has never been easier, and all the most common tasks around your home are covered--including electrical, plumbing, flooring, walls, windows and doors, cabinetry, insulating, heating and cooling, roofing and siding, and just about any repair or remodeling project you can imagine.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s4.postimg.org/t2o7crgdp/Black_Decker_The_Book_of_Home_How_To.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s4.postimg.org/t2o7crgdp/Black_Decker_The_Book_of_Home_How_To.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bf52aec1d21905c220f823e11e78d6222422c73","amp;dn":"Black+%26amp%3B+Decker+The+Book+of+Home+How-To%3A+The+Complete+Photo+G","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bf52aec1d21905c220f823e11e78d6222422c73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,245,42,236,29,33,144,92,34,15,130,62,17,231,141,98,34,66,44,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
