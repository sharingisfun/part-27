Each chapter is consistently organized beginning with a brief study of surface anatomy followed by concise coverage of osteology, presenting important foundational structures that will aid in localization of soft tissue structures. Each dissection unit begins with a &quot;Dissection Overview&quot; providing a guide of what is to be accomplished during the dissection session. This is followed by &quot;Dissection Instructions,&quot; with a logical sequence and numbered steps for the dissection. Each dissection concludes with a &quot;Dissection Review&quot; that presents a numbered lists of tasks illustrating the important features of the dissection and encouraging the synthesis of information.\n\n\n# Spiral-bound: 288 pages\n# Publisher: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins; Fifteenth, North American Edition edition (March 30, 2012)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1609136063\n# ISBN-13: 978-1609136062","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95df7c1fee4c69c6be7a3fd966fb75b8e13b5423","amp;dn":"Grant%27s+Dissector+%2C15th+Ed+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95df7c1fee4c69c6be7a3fd966fb75b8e13b5423","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,223,124,31,238,76,105,198,190,122,63,217,102,251,117,184,225,59,84,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
