It was originally founded in 1899 as &quot;The Technology Review&quot;, and was re-launched without the &quot;The&quot; in its name on April 23, 1998 under then publisher R. Bruce Journey. In September 2005 it underwent another transition under the current editor in chief and publisher, Jason Pontin, to something again resembling the historical magazine.\n\nBefore the 1998 re-launch, the editor stated that &quot;nothing will be left of the old magazine except the name.&quot; It is therefore necessary to distinguish between the modern and the historical Technology Review. The historical magazine had been published by the MIT Alumni Association, was more closely aligned with the interests of MIT alumni, and had a more intellectual tone and much smaller public circulation.\n\nUnder R. Bruce Journey, the magazine, billed from 1998 to 2005 as &quot;MIT's Magazine of Innovation,&quot; focused on new technology and how it gets commercialized; was mass-marketed to the public; and was targeted at senior executives, researchers, financiers, and policymakers, as well as for the MIT alumni.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fddbbe993a8118026230c4bd51836ca5133d22b5","amp;dn":"Technology+Review+Magazine+November-December+2009+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fddbbe993a8118026230c4bd51836ca5133d22b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,219,190,153,58,129,24,2,98,48,196,189,81,131,108,165,19,61,34,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
