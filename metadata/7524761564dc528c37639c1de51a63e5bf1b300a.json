He was raised on Clearview Avenue in Naamans Gardens, a suburb of Wilmington.\n\nGeorge and the Destroyers are also notable for undertaking a rigorous touring schedule after appearing throughout the Rolling Stones tour in 1981. After two shows in Boulder, Colorado, George and his band flew to Hawaii and played for only one night. The next night they appeared in Alaska for one show. The following day the band flew to Washington State, met their roadies who had their Checker car and a truck, and continued a one show per state tour for all fifty states in exactly fifty nights. In addition, they played Washington, DC on the same day that they performed a show in Maryland.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7524761564dc528c37639c1de51a63e5bf1b300a","amp;dn":"George+Thorogood+%26+The+Destroyers+-+Rock+And+Roll+Christmas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7524761564dc528c37639c1de51a63e5bf1b300a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,36,118,21,100,220,82,140,55,99,156,29,229,26,99,229,191,27,48,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
