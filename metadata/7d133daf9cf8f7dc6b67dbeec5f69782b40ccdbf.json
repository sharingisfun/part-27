Thanks to mx3.ch you can listen to their first radio single Ã¢â‚¬Å“You Gotta SwingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on national swiss radio DRS3. Now also on swiss radio channels Radio 105, Radio ZÃƒÂ¼risee, Radio Couleur 3, Radio Basel 1 and Internetradio 108. Watch the according videoclip on VIVA TV, SF2 Roboclip or Radio/TV 105.\n\nJessy remembers having composed the tune and almost all its lyrics while heading to go out. Quickly - so as not to forget the melody - she sung it onto ChrisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ answering machine only to find that he had used her recorded voice in a speeded up version. They loved the idea and the change of tempo and finished the song as it can be heard today.\n\nWith bassist GÃƒÂ©za Burghardt, keyboardist Dave McLeod and drummer Simon Kistler they truly are a ravishing lot. A lotÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ a whole lot of groove, plenty of crunchy rock nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll guitar and a subtle attitude ÃƒÂ  la the 30ties. Marvellous and delicious tunes that make you wanna shake, dance, sing and dream along as well. Jessy HoweÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice however definitely does not agree with her angelic looks. You would believe a Ã¢â‚¬Å“darkerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ soul was in possession of such a lassie. Something fresh, something new, something ravishingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ The Raveners!
