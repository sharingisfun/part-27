But that's about all they have in common. Ryan has spent the last decade in China building his career as a documentary photographer. Colin stayed closer to home, in Toronto, and built up his own successful currency trading company, which he recently resigned from. Together they have just completed a 65 day - 18,000km - motorcycle journey around China. They have traveled through some of the country's most populous and remote regions, while at the same time making a documentary film. The purpose of the film is to put China on display. To explore the visual and cultural wonders that is China. With a massive population, crowded cities, abundant minorities and its stunning natural landscape; China offers a traveler an experience like no other. And we're hoping you'll come along for the ride, on one of the world's greatest adventures. Our films title is: &quot;The Middle Kingdom Ride&quot;, as China's historical name was once &quot;The Middle Kingdom&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4)  Towards Tibet \r\nAfter Ryan has recovered from the worst motorcycle fall he's ever had, the Pyle brothers aim for Tibet on the G219 highway, passing mountains and lakes including one of the most holy places in Asia, Lake Manasarovar. Their ultimate goal is Mount Everest Base Camp, but it's not going to come easy. They end up camping on a desolate road 4000m above sea level. As Ryan attempts to celebrate his 32nd birthday, his bike's clutch burns out and the brothers are stranded in Zhongba, their fate in the hands of a local bike mechanic and facing the very real possibility that their epic journey could come to a premature end.\r\n\r\n5)  Mount Everest and Lhasa \r\nA local Zhongba motorcycle repairman comes to the Pyle brother's rescue, managing to get the BMW bike clutch back in working order. But further disaster strikes when Colin's bike blows a tyre. The journey is now in real jeopardy, with both bikes off the road and no clutch parts available in all of China. When the bike part finally arrives from Toronto, and Ryan and Colin make it to Mount Everest Base Camp, 12,500km from Shanghai. Their sense of achievement is fleeting; on their way back to Lhasa, they discover the road into Eastern Tibet has been indefinitely closed.\r\n\r\n6)  Shangri La to Shanghai \r\nThe closure of the Eastern Tibetan border forces the Pyle brothers to travel by plane reconnecting with their bikes in Shangri-La. From here they head to Guizhou province, but the improvement of the road tarmac and heavy rain make the road travel incredibly dangerous and Colin smashes his bike into a tree. Back on the road with new street tyres, Ryan and Colin make their way through the mystical karst landscape of Guilin and on to the manufacturing heartland of China before striking out for Shanghai, via Putoushan Island and the Yangshan Port, the biggest and busiest port in the world.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e5/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7d/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a1/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/71/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/88/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d8/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cb/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4b/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f6/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a4/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/56/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b5/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b3/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/04/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c4/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b8/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3173 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 24mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 520 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2524222/?ref_=tt_ov_inf \nhttp://www.toughrides.tv/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c635b8f1d8cec72d132d7137d0640ad7f39ff7c8","amp;dn":"Tough+Rides+China+Series+1+4of6+Towards+Tibet+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c635b8f1d8cec72d132d7137d0640ad7f39ff7c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,53,184,241,216,206,199,45,19,45,113,55,208,100,10,215,243,159,247,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
