This live album from Paris is an excellent example of their art,\nopening with the lengthy &quot;Somewhere over the Seine&quot; has strong swirling\nsaxophone over a deep bass and drum pocket. Strong exciting collective\nimprovisation takes hold, with each instrument bubbling to the forefront and\nthen slipping beneath the waves. Awesome fast trumpet from Campbell early in\nthe performance gives way to sawing bowed bass and nimble percussion. A section\nof trumpet and saxophone duet precedes a subtle trio section of saxophone, bass\nand brushed drums. &quot;Bolero Francaise&quot; is another extended improvisation, that\nopens is a very cool fashion with Campbell moving to flute and improvising\ngently with saxophone and shaken percussion and thick bass. An open and\nintimate bass and drums section slowly evolves, building to faster collective\nimprovisation. After a storming drum solo, the music builds to a very exciting\nsaxophone trio free and fast, and Campbell returns to trumpet and joins in to\nfinish things up. &quot;Avant Galoppi&quot; is a shorter fast paced improvisation that\nshows the band moving very quickly and responding to each other and the music\nas it develops. &quot;The Angle of Repose&quot; develops through an obtuse improvisation\nsection to a rousing conclusion. This was a very exciting and enjoyable album\nwhich is also quite accessible making this a good entry point for people who\nare curious about free improvisation.\n\n--\n\nBy Stef &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2010/10/nu-band-live-in-paris-no-business-2010.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2010/10/nu-band-live-in-paris-no-business-2010.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy John Sharpe &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=38367&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=38367&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDi Angelo Leonardi (it) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://italia.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=6235&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://italia.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=6235&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPar Guillaume Belhomme (fr) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://grisli.canalblog.com/archives/2010/11/02/19493439.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://grisli.canalblog.com/archives/2010/11/02/19493439.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63dea95f9ac8cdb2d0f3a31d4d1b4e489b19f4ac","amp;dn":"The+Nu+Band+-+Live+In+Paris+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63dea95f9ac8cdb2d0f3a31d4d1b4e489b19f4ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,222,169,95,154,200,205,178,208,243,163,29,77,27,78,72,155,25,244,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
