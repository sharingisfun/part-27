It ended in February/March 2014.\n\nThe neuroscience of drugs for therapy, for prevention, and for recreation.  Drug addiction and drug abuse. YouÃ‚â€™ll learn the prospects for new generations of medications in neurology, psychiatry, aging, and treatment of substance abuse. \n\nWhat happens in the body when a person smokes a cigarette? After several weeks of smoking? When a person takes antidepressant or antipsychotic medication? A drug for pain, migraine, or epilepsy? A recreational drug? Neuroscientists are beginning to understand these processes. YouÃ‚â€™ll learn how drugs enter the brain, how they act on receptors and ion channels, and how Ã‚â€œmolecular relay racesÃ‚â€ lead to changes in nerve cells and neural circuits that far outlast the drugs themselves. Ã‚â€œDrugs and the BrainÃ‚â€ also describes how scientists are gathering the knowledge required for the next steps in preventing or alleviating ParkinsonÃ‚â€™s, AlzheimerÃ‚â€™s, schizophrenia, and drug abuse.\n\nMore information about this course is available at https://coursera.org/course/drugsandbrain\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:802f6fff5c5f4bf01f23aefad0e7aaeb8d2ff545","amp;dn":"%5BCoursera%5D+Drugs+and+the+Brain","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"802f6fff5c5f4bf01f23aefad0e7aaeb8d2ff545","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,47,111,255,92,95,75,240,31,35,174,250,208,231,170,235,141,47,245,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
