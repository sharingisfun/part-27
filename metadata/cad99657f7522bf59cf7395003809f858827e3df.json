Based on past experience and this first wave of thusly-tagged rips, anything below 400 dpi (2,560 pixels wide, at standard aspect ratio) is to be considered &quot;ordinary&quot; and anything above 450 dpi (~3k pixels wide at standard AR) &quot;ultra&quot;.\n\nTo illustrate what the releases are actually like, I'm replacing the usual cover image by an interior sample here - a scaled-down page on the left, and a full-size detail from the centre of that page on the right, with the green frame pointing out the corresponding portions.\n\nEnjoy! :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cad99657f7522bf59cf7395003809f858827e3df","amp;dn":"%5BuHD%5D+Les+Amis+d%27Atalante+%28Artbook%29+%28Soleil%7Cc2c%27%27450%2B300%7CEmpire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cad99657f7522bf59cf7395003809f858827e3df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,217,150,87,247,82,43,245,156,247,57,80,3,128,159,133,136,39,227,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
