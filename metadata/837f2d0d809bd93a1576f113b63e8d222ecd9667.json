The basic plot of the show is about video game characters that come to life, re-enacting their deadly plans for wanton destruction and world domination in the real world. The first episode introduces the protagonist, Dr. Gus Lloyd, a matters-physicist, engineer and video game designer who has created a live-action game in his spare time to exert his indignant feelings about people in his life who have all made his life hell on Earth (his father, his ex-wife's mother, his ex-wife's divorce lawyer, his ex-girlfriend, his former employer, a high school football-Quarterback bully, his old camp counselor, etc.); the villains of the game are modeled after all these people. \n\nIncludes these episodes:\n\nS01e01 - Killshot\nS01e02 - One Mean Mother\nS01e03 - The Boss\nS01e04 - The End of the Jackal\nS01e05 - The Camp Counselor pt1\nS01e06 - The Camp Counselor pt2\nS01e07 - The Practical Joker\nS01e08 - The Car Mechanic\nS01e09 - The Divorce Lawyer\nS01e10 - The Motivational Speaker\nS01e11 - The Trash Man\nS01e12 - Dr. Kramer\n\n\nThe last 5 minutes of the final episode &quot;S01e12 - Dr. Kramer&quot; are cut out I was not able to get it.

If anyone has the last 5 minutes of episode 12 or episode 13 could you make a new torrent or get in contact with me through the comments  Thanks.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:837f2d0d809bd93a1576f113b63e8d222ecd9667","amp;dn":"Deadly+Games+%281995-1996%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"837f2d0d809bd93a1576f113b63e8d222ecd9667","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,127,45,13,128,155,217,58,21,118,241,19,182,62,141,34,46,205,150,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
