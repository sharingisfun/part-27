All three best friends and Braithwaite's new love interest and soon to be fiancÃƒÂ©e Sophia Tardelli (played by Kasia Smutniak) suffer a car accident which puts MuÃƒÂ±ez out of contention through injuries. Meanwhile, Liam Adams discovers to his horror that he has a new daughter, Bella, from former love interest June (played by Anya Lahiri). This only adds to Liam's preexisting alcoholism and release from Real Madrid. It is revealed that MuÃƒÂ±ez is set to return to England as a Tottenham Hotspur player under a two-year contract, along with Adams, who re-signs for Newcastle United, the original club of both ex-Real players. The film goes on to depict the World Cup from the English perspective. Liam scores against Sweden (2-2), assisted by a header from Charlie, and England qualify for the knock-out stages. However, in the match against Ecuador, Braithwaite is injured, and later collapses in the changing room. Braithwaite is rushed to hospital, and dies on the way from an aneurysm (from the car accident). England crash out of the quarter-finals against Portugal as Adams misses a crucial penalty against Portuguese keeper Ricardo while Cristiano Ronaldo converts.\n\nAdams later proposes June to marry him. Santiago Munez is the Best Man. During his wedding speech he remembers Charlie and his eyes get teary. As confetti is thrown on Liam and June, Italy are shown lifting the World Cup Trophy after beating France on penalties in the final.\n\nAlso following the tournament around Germany in their St. George's Cross festooned camper van are the &quot;Geordie Boys&quot;, whom we first met back in the first Goal! film. Providing the entertaining fans' perspective of the matches are Newcastle United die-hards Gordon (Mike Elliott), Foghorn (Christopher Fairbank), Walter (Jack McBride), and Phil (Craig Heaney) in their drunken, womanizing adventures in Germany.\n\nUnlike in the first two films, Roz, Gandhi, Glen Foy, and Gavin Harris do not feature in the film. Santiago implies that he and Roz did not get back together following their separation. As shown is the second movie, Foy was fired by Santiago. As for Harris, it was time he retired. All actual professional footballers are shown through stock World Cup footage. The sporting role of the actors in this film is limited to the green screen. In selected scenes, an unknown bald man is used as a double for Sven-GÃƒÂ¶ran Eriksson. This movie reveals the possible end of goal trilogy as the dream ends.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e42a255335f01b45a13b986b436a70d157007248","amp;dn":"GOAL+3-TAKING+ON+THE+WORLD+%28WITH+GR+SUBS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e42a255335f01b45a13b986b436a70d157007248","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,42,37,83,53,240,27,69,161,59,152,107,67,106,112,209,87,0,114,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
