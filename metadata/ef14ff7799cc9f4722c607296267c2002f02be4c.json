All songs were written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young, and Bon Scott. It was originally released on Albert Productions. A modified international edition was released on Atlantic Records in June 1977.\nLet There Be Rock was also the last AC/DC recording to feature bassist Mark Evans, who previously played on T.N.T. (1975) and Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (1976).\nOn 3 April 1977, AC/DC filmed a live performance of &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot; for Australia's Countdown. In July 1977, the band further promoted Let There Be Rock by filming a music video for the album's title track. Recorded in a church in Perth, it featured Scott as a priest and the rest of the band as altar boys.[1]\nThis edition was eventually repackaged with the international version's cover (see image), marking the first time an Australian AC/DC album cover was matched to its corresponding international edition.\nIn 1980, AC/DC released a live concert motion picture titled AC/DC: Let There Be Rock. In 1997, an expanded audio recording of this concert was released on CD as Let There Be Rock: The Movie, on discs 2-3 of the Bonfire box set.\nAs with AC/DC's previous albums, there were differences between Let There Be Rock's Australian and international edition, released in June 1977. However, the Australian version of Let There Be Rock was originally available in international markets outside the United States and Japan, but only on original vinyl printings. All international CD releases contain the modified track listing.\nAtlantic Records removed the racy &quot;Crabsody In Blue&quot; from the true international version. It was replaced with a shortened version of &quot;Problem Child&quot; from the Australian version of the album Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, released in September 1976. &quot;Crabsody In Blue&quot; has not been officially released internationally on CD.\nThe international version's cover also marked the debut of the band's logo.\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef14ff7799cc9f4722c607296267c2002f02be4c","amp;dn":"ACDC+-+Let+There+Be+Rock+%281977%29+%5BLOSSLESS+FLAC%5D%5BTntvillage.Scamb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef14ff7799cc9f4722c607296267c2002f02be4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,20,255,119,153,204,159,71,34,198,7,41,98,103,194,0,47,2,190,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
