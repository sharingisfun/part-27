Then thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Franco himself, who prowls backstage, peering out between the linesÃ¢â‚¬â€before taking the stage with fascinating meditations on his art, along with nightmarish tales of excess. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hollywood has always been a private club,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he writes. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I open the gates. I say welcome. I say, Look inside.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Told in a dizzying array of stylesÃ¢â‚¬â€from lyric essays and disarming testimonials to hilariously rambling text messages and ghostly footnotesÃ¢â‚¬â€and loosely modeled on Alcoholics AnonymousÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions, Actors Anonymous is an intense, wild ride into the dark heart of celebrity.\n\nUnabridged.\nRead by James Franco.\n\n------------------------------\nVisit us:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws\n------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84db990fb7edb0a6d0539d3c3a20870db06293de","amp;dn":"Actors+Anonymous+-+James+Franco","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84db990fb7edb0a6d0539d3c3a20870db06293de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,219,153,15,183,237,176,166,208,83,157,60,58,32,135,13,176,98,147,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
