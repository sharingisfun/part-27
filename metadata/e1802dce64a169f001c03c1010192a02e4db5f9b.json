Sonny's LP COOL STRUTTIN (1958 Blue \n\nNote) actually deserves the overused term CLASSIC.\n\n\nTracks #2 and #5 are incorrectly titled on both the packaging and the CD. \n\nI've correctly titled them in capital letters so you can quickly see the changes\n\nI've made.  Track 2 is obviously COOL STRUTTIN, not IT'S TIME.  Track #5\n\nis not COOL STRUTTIN'....it is in fact another Clark original entitled BLUE\n\nMINOR\n\n\nAt a younger age I tangled with the trombone myself....I know how bloody \n\ndifficult it is to tame this beast","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1802dce64a169f001c03c1010192a02e4db5f9b","amp;dn":"Bennie+Green+%28trombone%281960%29TIME+records%29+Sonny+Clark","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1802dce64a169f001c03c1010192a02e4db5f9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,128,45,206,100,161,105,240,1,192,60,16,16,25,42,2,228,219,95,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
