Jones have formed a band called &quot;J.P., Chrissie and the Fairground Boys&quot;. They released their debut album, Fidelity, on August 24, 2010, and they are currently on tour. Several stops on the tour were recorded and sold on usb flash drives.\n\nChristine Ellen &quot;Chrissie&quot; Hynde (born 7 September 1951, Akron, Ohio) is an American rock musician, best known as the leader of the rock/new wave band The Pretenders. She is a singer, songwriter, and guitarist, and has been the only constant member of the band throughout its history. As a rare, successful female bandleader and style-setter in the early days of 1970s punk and new wave, Hynde had a major impact on the music scene.\n\nEssentially a vehicle for Chrissie Hynde, especially since the deaths of James Honeyman Scott and Chris Farndon precipitated the end of the original foursome, the Pretenders have never exactly been prolific. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s taken them thirty years to record nine albums. So, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s curious to see Hynde with a new album ready only two years after Break Up the Concrete.\n\nThe bigger surprise is that itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not a Pretenders album. Thus begins our Welsh guy walks into a bar story.\n\nJ.P. Jones is a Welsh singer-songwriter. His band Grace signed to EMI and were groomed for success that never came. At loose ends, Jones spots Hynde in a bar, introduces himself, expresses admiration for her work and make a case for his own.\n\nHynde is fifty-eight, a Rock and Roll Hall of Famer, twice married, and mother of two grown children. Jones is thirty-two, or as Hynde sings on the opening cut ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPerfect LoverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhalf my age.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Much has been made of their relationship status in the press. Hell, Fidelity is all about it. Fidelity is also a fine collection of songs from a killer band that includes some of the best vocal performances of HyndeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s storied career.\n\nFidelity is credited to JP, Chrissie and the Fairground Boys. The Fairground Boys includes all or most of the members from JonesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s old band Grace. Sam SwallowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s piano work stands out on tracks like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIf You Let MeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMisty Valleys.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Guitarist Patrick Murdoch plays with the passion and precision (like a more rocking Mark Knopfler) weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve come to expect from HyndeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s six string foils. Honestly, Hynde lucked into a damn good band. \n\nFidelity is basically a cougar version of Double Fantasy. It could have been dreadful. While not without its TMI moments, HyndeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s consummate skills as writer and singer shine through, and Jones hold his own in loveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s blow by blow. \n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce9eacf4626241e87276cd969366c0e52fa54af2","amp;dn":"JP%2C+Chrissie+Hynde+%26+The+Fairground+Boys-If+You+Let+Me%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce9eacf4626241e87276cd969366c0e52fa54af2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,158,172,244,98,98,65,232,114,118,205,150,147,102,192,229,47,165,74,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
