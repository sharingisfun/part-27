Surely, there are hits here â€“ not all of them, but &quot;You're So Vain,&quot; &quot;Mockingbird,&quot; &quot;You Belong to Me,&quot; and &quot;Anticipation&quot; are â€“ but there are also some deep cuts, a track from the Simon Sisters (&quot;Winken', Blinkin' and Nod&quot;) and other assorted rarities.\r\n\r\nEverything here shifts focus toward Simon the singer/songwriter and, as the memoir's narrative ends at 1983, so does the music on this collection and that's a good dividing point, considering she left Warner in 1983. She'd have a comeback not long afterward â€“ &quot;Coming Around Again&quot; climbed into the Top 20 in 1987 â€“ but this is her golden period as a singer/songwriter and pop star. If the latter is diminished a bit (her James Bond theme &quot;Nobody Does It Better&quot; and her 1980 soft rock hit &quot;Jesse&quot; are absent), seek out Rhino's 2002 set Anthology for a fuller portrait of Simon as a hit-maker; turn here if you want to get a sense of what Simon believes truly reflects her soul as an artist.\r\n\r\nCD1\r\n01 - Boys in the Trees\r\n02 - Winkin', Blinkin' and Nod - The Simon Sisters\r\n03 - Orpheus\r\n04 - Older Sister\r\n05 - It Was So Easy\r\n06 - Embrace Me, You Child\r\n07 - Hello Big Man\r\n08 - Two Hot Girls (On a Hot Summer Night)\r\n09 - It Happens Everyday\r\n10 - His Friends Are More Than Fond of Robin\r\n11 - I'm All It Takes to Make You Happy\r\n12 - That's the Way I've Always Heard It Should Be\r\n13 - I've Got to Have You\r\n14 - Anticipation\r\n15 - Legend in Your Own Time\r\n16 - Three Days\r\n\r\nCD2\r\n01 - Julie Through the Glass\r\n02 - We Have No Secrets\r\n03 - You're So Vain\r\n04 - Mind on My Man\r\n05 - Mockingbird\r\n06 - After the Storm\r\n07 - Hounting\r\n08 - In Times When My Head\r\n09 - You Belong to Me\r\n10 - We're So Close\r\n11 - From the Heart\r\n12 - Come Upstairs\r\n13 - The Right Thing to Do\r\n14 - Showdown\r\n15 - I Can Thank You Enough\r\n\r\n*2015 Elektra / Rhino | 081227949495\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:579997a4ed423c6323aa2c49d1e19b90ada2fb22","amp;dn":"Carly+Simon+-+Songs+from+the+Trees%2C+A+Musical+Memoir+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"579997a4ed423c6323aa2c49d1e19b90ada2fb22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,153,151,164,237,66,60,99,35,170,44,73,209,225,155,144,173,162,251,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
