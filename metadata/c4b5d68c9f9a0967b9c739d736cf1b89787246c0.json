All tools are presented in a clear structure, providing a good overview of the methodology.\n\nThe chronology of the listed tools corresponds to the procedure in a Design for Six Sigma+Lean development project with the stages Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, and Verify. Due to this unique structure by which tools can be found and applied quickly we created a book that facilitates project work in practical use enormously. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4b5d68c9f9a0967b9c739d736cf1b89787246c0","amp;dn":"Design+for+Six+Sigma+%2B+LeanToolset%3A+Implementing+Innovations+Suc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4b5d68c9f9a0967b9c739d736cf1b89787246c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,181,214,140,159,154,9,103,185,199,57,215,54,207,27,137,120,114,70,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
