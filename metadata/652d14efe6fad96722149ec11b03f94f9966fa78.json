Without warning, their supposed allies in the Word Bearers Legion launch a devastating invasion of Calth, scattering the Ultramarines fleet and slaughtering all who stand in their way. This confirms the worst scenario Guilliman can imagine Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Lorgar means to settle their bitter rivalry once and for all. As the traitors summon foul daemonic hosts and all the forces of Chaos, the Ultramarines are drawn into a grim and deadly struggle in which neither side can prevail.\n\nABOUT THE BOOK\nWhen war comes to Calth and set the planet aflame, the Ultramarines face annihilation against a foe who will use any means to settle their bitter grudge.\n\nExtract: http://www.blacklibrary.com/Downloads/Product/PDF/k/know-no-fear.pdf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:652d14efe6fad96722149ec11b03f94f9966fa78","amp;dn":"Know+no+Fear+by+Dan+Abnett+-+Horus+Heresy+-+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"652d14efe6fad96722149ec11b03f94f9966fa78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,45,20,239,230,250,217,103,34,20,158,193,27,3,249,79,153,102,250,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
