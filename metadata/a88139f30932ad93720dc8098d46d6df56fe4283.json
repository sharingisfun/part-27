Bassett and a sequel to the 2006 film Silent Hill. Revelation stars Adelaide Clemens, Kit Harington, Deborah Kara Unger, Martin Donovan, Malcolm McDowell, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Sean Bean, and is based on the survival horror video game Silent Hill 3 by Konami.[5] Revelation's plot follows teenager Heather Mason (Clemens) who discovers on the eve of her eighteenth birthday that her presumed identity is false and as a result is drawn to an alternate dimension existing in the fictitious American town of Silent Hill.\nPrior to the beginning of Revelation's filming, Bassett expressed his openness to fan's suggestions of actresses for Heather's role. On an estimated $20 million budget, filming lasted from March to May 2011 in Canada, with the 3D RED Epic camera used for the process; audio mixing took place in France. Revelation has grossed $50,622,655 as of January 10, 2013,[6][7] and has received mainly negative reviews by film critics.\n\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0938330/\n\n\npls. seed after download...
