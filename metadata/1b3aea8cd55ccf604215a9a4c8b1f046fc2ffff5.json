Political economist Alperovitz takes the pulse of this collective fiscal dissatisfaction here and offers some tantalizing but well-grounded ideas about closing the income gap without sliding into socialism. The author begins by deconstructing politics as usual and deflating the notion that progressive policies can provide much real guidance. Because banks are more stable these days, major crises like the recent recession are also unlikely to provoke much transformation. According to Alperovitz, something different beyond token protests and special-interest groups is necessary for true systemic change, and this difference comes in the form of more worker-owned and -operated companies, neighborhood corporations, and locally run public enterprises. AlperovitzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deliberately informal, conversational style makes normally rarefied economic concepts accessible to a wide audience, enhancing his inspiring message that, with the right strategies, a wholesale economic revolution is not only possible but achievable by well-organized, average citizens. --Carl Hays \nGenre: Politics, Sociology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b3aea8cd55ccf604215a9a4c8b1f046fc2ffff5","amp;dn":"What+Then+Must+We+Do+Straight+Talk+about+the+Next+American+Revol","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b3aea8cd55ccf604215a9a4c8b1f046fc2ffff5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,58,234,140,213,92,207,96,66,21,169,164,200,177,240,70,252,47,255,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
