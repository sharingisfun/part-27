In the process, the people of the country now known as Myanmar have developed a rich, complex cuisine that mekes inventive use of easily available ingredients to create exciting flavor combinations.\nSalads are one of the best entry points into the glories of this cuisine, with sparkling flavorsÃ¢â‚¬â€crispy fried shallots, a squeeze of fresh lime juice, a dash of garlic oil, a pinch of turmeric, some crunchy roast peanutsÃ¢â‚¬â€balanced with a light hand. The salad tradition is flexible; Burmese cooks transform all kinds of foods into salads, from chicken and roasted eggplant to spinach and tomato. And the enticing Tea-Leaf Salad is a signature dish in central Burma and in the eastern hills that are home to the Shan people.\nInterspersed throughout the 125 recipes are intriguing tales from the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s many trips to this fascinating but little-known land. One such captivating essay shows how Burmese women adorn themselves with thanaka, a white paste used to protect and decorate the skin. Buddhism is a central fact of Burmese life: we meet barefoot monks on their morning quest for alms, as well as nuns with shaved heads; and Duguid takes us on tours of Shwedagon, the amazingly grand temple complex on a hill in Rangoon, the former capital. She takes boats up BurmaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s huge rivers, highways to places inaccessible by road; spends time in village markets and home kitchens; and takes us to the farthest reaches of the country, along the way introducing us to the fascinating people she encounters on her travels.\nThe best way to learn about an unfamiliar culture is through its food, and in Burma: Rivers of Flavor, readers will be transfixed by the splendors of an ancient and wonderful country, untouched by the outside world for generations, whose simple recipes delight and satisfy and whose people are among the most gracious on earth.\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img836.imageshack.us/img836/1131/naomiduguid.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img836.imageshack.us/img836/1131/naomiduguid.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nNaomi Duguid (born 1950 in Ottawa, Ontario) is a Canadian food writer, best known for her cookbooks co-written with her ex-husband Jeffrey Alford.
