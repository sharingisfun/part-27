They had some hits, Blood &amp; Roses, Girl Like You, Behind the Wall of sleep etc and then faded away. They didn't break up .... Nope, they just got better.\nThe last few years has seen the band release four albums ( Meet the Smithereens - highly recommended, Christmas with...., Besides the Beatles and Live at Court Tavern --- A must for Smithereens fans and fans of searing rock and roll in general) and a fifth is rumoured to be on the way.\nToday's post is a live ep from 1987, long out of print from the Restless Performance Series.\nThree of the tracks are from their debut Especially For You, Two from some early ep's and a killer version of the Who's the Seeker. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd894118727c5bfdfdc3a610773d118cabfad414","amp;dn":"The+Smithereens+-+Live+at+the+Ritz+1986","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd894118727c5bfdfdc3a610773d118cabfad414","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,137,65,24,114,124,91,253,253,195,166,16,119,61,17,140,171,250,212,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
