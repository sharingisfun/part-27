(WP, 2013).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-0-85709-513-8\r\n\r\nMany food ingredients are supplied in powdered form, as reducing water content increases shelf life and aids ease of storage, handling and transport. Powder technology is therefore of great importance to the food industry. The Handbook of food powders explores a variety of processes that are involved in the production of food powders, the further processing of these powders and their functional properties.\r\n\r\nPart one introduces processing and handling technologies for food powders and includes chapters on spray, freeze and drum drying, powder mixing in the production of food powders and safety issues around food powder production processes. Part two focusses on powder properties including surface composition, rehydration and techniques to analyse the particle size of food powders. Finally, part three highlights speciality food powders and includes chapters on dairy powders, fruit and vegetable powders and coating foods with powders.\r\n\r\nThe Handbook of food powders is a standard reference for professionals in the food powder production and handling industries, development and quality control professionals in the food industry using powders in foods, and researchers, scientists and academics interested in the field.\r\n\r\nExplores the processing and handling technologies in the production of food powders\r\nExamines powder properties, including surface composition, shelf life, and techniques used to examine particle size\r\nFocusses on speciality powders such as dairy, infant formulas, powdered egg, fruit and vegetable, and culinary and speciality products","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e89d0f9fa03100969eab697d35feeabe15c7da1","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Food+Powders+Processes+and+Properties","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e89d0f9fa03100969eab697d35feeabe15c7da1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,137,208,249,250,3,16,9,105,234,182,151,211,95,238,171,225,92,125,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
