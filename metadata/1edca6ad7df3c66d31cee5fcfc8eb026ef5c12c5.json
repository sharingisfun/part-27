This is the final version on 2013, no more improvements planned. If it cannot display a flag, the problem is on the DNSBL site.\n\nYou can seed it with itself.\n\nUsage:\n  * Set peer.resolve_country = true in Advanced Options.\n  * Throw out flags.conf and flags.bmp to hell. Built-in flags forever!\n  * Learn geography :-)\n\nChanges from the version with 242 flags+:\n  * Added flags of CuraÃƒÂ§ao, Guernsey, Jersey, Sint Maarten and South Sudan.\n  * Added list of two-letter domains treated as non-geographic, see below.\n  * Dotless names like &quot;localhost&quot; or &quot;none&quot; now are non-geographic too.\n  * Changed flag of Libya.\n  * Removed flags of Antilles and European Union as well as the flag of the Soviet Union wasn't added.\n\nList of countries (246 total):\n  AD, AE, AF, AG, AI, AL, AM, AO, AR, AS, AT, AU, AW, AX, AZ,\n  BA, BB, BD, BE, BF, BG, BH, BI, BJ, BM, BN, BO, BR, BS, BT, BV, BW, BY, BZ,\n  CA, CC, CD, CF, CG, CH, CI, CK, CL, CM, CN, CO, CR, CS, CU, CV, CW, CX, CY, CZ,\n  DE, DJ, DK, DM, DO, DZ,\n  EC, EE, EG, EH, ER, ES, ET,\n  FI, FJ, FK, FM, FO, FR,\n  GA, GD, GE, GF, GG, GH, GI, GL, GM, GN, GP, GQ, GR, GS, GT, GU, GW, GY,\n  HK, HM, HN, HR, HT, HU,\n  ID, IE, IL, IM, IN, IO, IQ, IR, IS, IT,\n  JE, JM, JO, JP,\n  KE, KG, KH, KI, KM, KN, KP, KR, KW, KY, KZ,\n  LA, LB, LC, LI, LK, LR, LS, LT, LU, LV, LY,\n  MA, MC, MD, ME, MG, MH, MK, ML, MM, MN, MO, MP, MQ, MR, MS, MT, MU, MV, MW, MX, MY, MZ,\n  NA, NC, NE, NF, NG, NI, NL, NO, NP, NR, NU, NZ,\n  OM,\n  PA, PE, PF, PG, PH, PK, PL, PM, PN, PR, PS, PT, PW, PY,\n  QA,\n  RE, RO, RS, RU, RW,\n  SA, SB, SC, SD, SE, SG, SH, SI, SJ, SK, SL, SM, SN, SO, SR, SS, ST, SV, SX, SY, SZ,\n  TC, TD, TF, TG, TH, TJ, TK, TL, TM, TN, TO, TR, TT, TV, TW, TZ,\n  UA, UG, UK, UM, US, UY, UZ,\n  VA, VC, VE, VG, VI, VN, VU,\n  WF, WS,\n  YE, YT,\n  ZA, ZM, ZW\n\nTwo-letter domains treating as non-geographic, getting real flag by IP:\n  AN, CC, EU, FM, IM, IO, NU, SU, TC, TK, TO, TP, TV, WS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1edca6ad7df3c66d31cee5fcfc8eb026ef5c12c5","amp;dn":"uTorrent+2.0.4+with+buit-in+246+country+flags","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1edca6ad7df3c66d31cee5fcfc8eb026ef5c12c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,220,166,173,125,243,198,109,49,206,229,252,252,142,176,38,239,92,18,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
