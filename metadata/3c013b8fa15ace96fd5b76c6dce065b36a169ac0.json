So how did he go from hapless office worker and serial failure to the creator of Dilbert, one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most famous syndicated comic strips, in just a few years? In How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big, Adams shares the strategy he has used since he was a teen to invite failure in, embrace it, then pick its pocket.\nNo career guide can offer advice that works for everyone. As Adams explains, your best bet is to study the ways of others who made it big and try to glean some tricks and strategies that make sense for you. Adams pulls back the covers on his own unusual life and shares how he turned one failure after another into something good and lasting.\nAdams reveals that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s failed at just about everything heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tried, including his corporate career, his inventions, his investments, and his two restaurants. But thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a lot to learn from his personal story, and a lot of humor along the way. Adams discovered some unlikely truths that helped to propel him forward. For instance:\nÃ¯Â¿Â½ Goals are for losers. Systems are for winners. Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½PassionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is bull. What you need is personal energy. Ã¯Â¿Â½ A combination of mediocre skills can make you surprisingly valuable. Ã¯Â¿Â½ You can manage your odds in a way that makes you look lucky to others.\n\nAdams hopes you can laugh at his failures while discovering some unique and helpful ideas on your own path to personal victory. As he writes:\nÃ¯Â¿Â½This is a story of one personÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unlikely success within the context of scores of embarrassing failures. Was my eventual success primarily a result of talent, luck, hard work, or an accidental just-right balance of each? All I know for sure is that I pursued a conscious strategy of managing my opportunities in a way that would make it easier for luck to find me.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n================\n\nDovah","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c013b8fa15ace96fd5b76c6dce065b36a169ac0","amp;dn":"Scott+Adams%2C+How+to+Fail+at+Almost+Everything+and+Still+Win+Big+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c013b8fa15ace96fd5b76c6dce065b36a169ac0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,1,59,143,161,90,206,150,253,91,118,198,220,224,101,179,106,22,154,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
