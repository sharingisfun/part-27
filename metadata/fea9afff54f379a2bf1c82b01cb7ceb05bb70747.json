Perhaps even the best - although I have\nsome Bach Chopin and Beethoven pieces that are equally on the same list.\n\nI have always best liked the renditions by the Italian group I. Musici - \noften found on the Philips Label (Holland). We are be posting that for \nyou too - both in video (already posted) and mp3 formats.\n\nFor this particular torrent, we offer the Academy of Ancient Music \nfeaturing Conductor Christopher Hogwood doing this great piece some\nkind of justice in their fair efforts too equally I'm sure\n\nFor those who like this work so much that they wouldn't\nwant to miss out on hearing different renditions that are in the main\npopular, help yourselves here too certainly!\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nmusicfromrizzo\n\n192k uniformly used bitrate for this folder\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fea9afff54f379a2bf1c82b01cb7ceb05bb70747","amp;dn":"Vivaldi+The+Four+Seasons+-+Chris+Hogwood+-+%28musicfromrizzo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fea9afff54f379a2bf1c82b01cb7ceb05bb70747","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,169,175,255,84,243,121,162,191,28,130,176,28,183,206,176,91,183,7,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
