Many of their EPs charted in the now (since 1968) defunct EP chart and most of their original studio albums charted in various UK album charts during their career. Along with Cliff Richard they effectively snuffed out skiffle music by 1959, but were themselves increasingly sidelined by a multi-pronged combination of Beatlemania, Merseybeat, The Rolling Stones, The Who, and many other major British 60s groups during 1963-64.\nFive years ahead of Beatle-mania, The Shadows, along with Cliff Richard, laid the foundations of British rock-n-roll music during 1958-1962. During that five year period they were the UK's only major rock group with no significant home grown competition. Notwithstanding their popularity in the early 60s, in the wake of a 'Golden Greats' marketing ploy by their UK record label EMI, then and as separate entities, but unlike no other chart acts before or since then, The Shadows and Cliff Richard enjoyed a massive 2nd wave revival spell of success and interest in their music from the late-1970's until disbandment in 1990. In the 1960s The Shadows paved the way for many thousands of similar guitar-based groups in the wake of their 'Apache' hit single. Their eponymous debut original studio album, The Shadows (album), remains a benchmark standard rock-instrumental album of 'classic' status proportions. Their unique guitar sound was produced by American guitars made by Fender in conjunction with British amplifiers made by Vox with an Italian made SFX Meazzi echo unit.\nSelling many millions of records worldwide, but unlike no other hugely successful group, The Shadows have generated so many polarized opinions on the merits of their type of music. However, The Shadows are consistently appreciated by instrumental fans, guitar enthusiasts and musicians both professional and amateur. In the 21st century they continue to enjoy the dedicated patronage of a loyal hard core of worldwide fans. When they tour the UK and abroad, their good-humoured concerts always sell out at premier division venues. They last toured the USA in 1959 with Cliff Richard.\nThe Shadows were pioneers of the rock group format in the UK and as such they were subject to a steep learning curve without the benefit of a previous British group to emulate. Conventional wisdom in these matters was subsequently gleaned out of the Shadows experience. Thus in a minority of cases those groups in the UK whose original line-ups were assembled by an outsider, such as a producer or manager with a specific project in mind, have enjoyed only limited success.\nSince then, based on the Shadows experience, virtually all other UK-based pop/rock bands have formed their own foundation line-up from within using a non-Shadows methodology adhering to now well established principles as used by other groups who self-created either at high-school eg The Jam or college or university or outside education eg The Beatles, but whose musical directions and influences (eg Elvis or Chuck Berry etc) and geographical origins (eg Liverpool) were all similar thus minimizing potential areas of friction within the band during its lifespan.\n\nAlbum's in this Torrent\n\nTRACK LIST - ESTABLISHED (1958)\n\n01.
