These techniques can be viewed as generalizations of Melnikov's method to multi-degree of freedom systems subject to slowly varying parameters and quasiperiodic excitations. A unique feature of the book is that each theorem is illustrated with drawings that enable the reader to build visual pictures of global dynamcis of the systems being described. This approach leads to an enhanced intuitive understanding of the theory.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28505c6ae84cf77ca057361e9a8bf4c6f7f08bac","amp;dn":"%5BDJVU%5D+%5B1988%5D+Global+bifurcations+and+chaos+analytical+methods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28505c6ae84cf77ca057361e9a8bf4c6f7f08bac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,80,92,106,232,76,247,124,160,87,54,30,154,139,244,198,247,240,139,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
