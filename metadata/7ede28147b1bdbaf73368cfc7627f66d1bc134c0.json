Basically just drop the two folders labeled Aerosoft and effects into your FSX folder. for some reason the folder containing the .bgls was labeled &quot;leylstadX&quot; which would be unrecognized by FSX. I renamed it scenery and included an empty folder with the original name. To use the season configurator you may have to rename the scenery folder to the original, not really sure because I usually don't bother with seasons - it seems like I always want it sunny summer when I go flying.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ede28147b1bdbaf73368cfc7627f66d1bc134c0","amp;dn":"FSX++Aerosoft_Lelystad.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ede28147b1bdbaf73368cfc7627f66d1bc134c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,222,40,20,123,27,219,175,115,54,140,252,118,39,246,109,27,193,52,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
