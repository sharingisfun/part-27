The Firstborn convinces Leach to help it escape from the Box. Leach leaves the DOW, and spends the next twenty years committing acts of great evil to build up evil energy to cause a breach in the Box.\n\nEventually, a breach is made, and the DOW sends in a Special Forces team called Jericho to seal the breach. Being unable to seal it any other way, they enter the Box to close the breach from within.\n\nOnce inside, they must battle the souls of those who have breached the Box in the past; a Nazi officer, a fallen Catholic priest from the Middle Ages, a depraved Roman Governor, and six ancient Sumerian priests (Ninlil and Ki, Inanna and Enlil as well as Nanna and Utu, who were the first to banish the Firstborn but ultimately fell victim to its corruption). Jericho is aided by the souls of those who ultimately resealed the breach each time it was broken.\n\nWhen they finally reach the point at which they can seal the breach, they decide that they should kill the Firstborn rather than try to reseal the breach, as resealing would just result in them being trapped in the Box and endlessly tortured until the breach was opened again. When Jericho passes into the Firstborn's cavern, they find the Firstborn in the middle of an island on a lake, with Leach tied to a wall. During the final battle between Jericho and the Firstborn, Leach breaks free of his bonds. Angered at the FirstbornÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s betrayal, he grabs it and carries it to a tunnel of light, with the fate of both left unknown.\n\nThe cavern soon begins to collapse. Jericho jumps into the water and swims as deep and far as they can. The game ends as they emerge from under the water in a vast ocean under an orange sky.\n\nThis is a repack\n\nHow to intall:\n-run installer and choose the destination directory\n-skip direct x ,visualcc,nvidia phisix,framework instalation\n-whait until is done\n-play\nAditional info:\n-if the game doesn`t run after ,go to redist folder and install the programs\n-necesary hdd space 4,5GB\n-to play the game go to the install directory=&gt;bin file=&gt; click jericho .exe or launcher.exe\n\nIf the game doesn`t run after you need to download  this:NVidiaPhysX-9.12.0613 from internet,but you need that version in order to make the game whorking.A new version of that software has came out ,but the game is crashing with the new one\n\nIf you like it ,seed it\n\nHappy gaming","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b669784fd17f815574a8ca8b2a2527a4e0aa0b05","amp;dn":"Clive+Barker%26rsquo%3Bs+Jericho","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b669784fd17f815574a8ca8b2a2527a4e0aa0b05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,105,120,79,209,127,129,85,116,168,202,139,42,37,39,164,224,170,11,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
