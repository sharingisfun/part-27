Inside the jail, he befriends another inmate, Esteban (Emilio), who becomes his rock and protector. Seven years later, Rommel is living in the province as a farmer together with Sita (Ara Mina) his wife. Esteban tracks down Rommel in hopes of renewing a brewing love affair. Rommel and Sita welcome Esteban into their lives, until their intimacy crosses borderlines and results in the undeniable scourge of self-discovery.\n\nWith soft Eng sub revised by OldMovieMan \n\nA film well worth watching. A psychological drama. A young guy gets sent to prison after an accident and encounters hell. The music is very well done with a piano and a sultry voice throughout. I'd give it a 6.5. The subs are in great shape now that 3 - 4000 typos have been fixed along with a little rephrasing. They are well timed.\n\nThe video is pretty good with a little pixelation. Audio is very good. say V=7, A=10\n\n === File Information ===                                                  \n Movie: Selda.avi                                                        \n Duration: 2:32:43                                                \n File Size: 1,051,169,312 bytes                                              \n === Video Information ===                                                 \n Video Codec Name:  DivX 6.2.5                                     \n Video Bitrate: 780                                            \n Quality Factor (Bits/Pixel): 0.148                                   \n Frames Per Second: 23.976 fps                             \n Display Aspect Ratio:  1.773                                        \n Frame Width &amp; Height(pixels):  624x352              \n === Audio Information ===                                                 \n Audio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                                                \n Audio Bitrate: 128                                            \n Audio Channel Count: 2                                \n \nThanks to katawootsn, also to the original upper and to the ripper","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f1c69f1ed3cea9b4d01f09dbf223c394e3b3618","amp;dn":"Selda_The+Inmate+%28Tagalog+%28Eng+Subs%29%29+2002","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f1c69f1ed3cea9b4d01f09dbf223c394e3b3618","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,28,105,241,237,60,234,155,77,1,240,157,191,34,60,57,78,59,54,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
