The airfield is located in the town of Porta Westfalica in the Minden-LÃƒÂ¼bbecke district. Meaning &quot;gate to Westphalia&quot; in Latin, Porta Westfalica is situated on the banks of the Weser River, near the Porta Westfalica gorge, where the river runs through the passage between the mountain chains of the Wiehen Hills in the west and the Weser Uplands in the east. The gorge appears like a gate to the region of Westphalia and is overlooked by the Jakobsberg and Wittekindsberg hills - all this captured in the beautiful photoreal.
