The rest? Maybe not!\nThe reality is that Google in particular is responsible for the amazing success of many people involved in this game, and also\nfor their demise.\nIt is the nature of the game we play, but be under no illusions, if you stay in the game long enough you will see an insane\nnumber of changes.\nOne day top rankings, the next day taken over by a Facebook note, a forum post, a spammy Youtube video blasted with\ndodgy links, or a one page EMD.\nI am not naÃƒÂ¯ve enough to dismiss this.\nWe want monies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:056496ad68097e08394bfdec720d00e7f15c5d04","amp;dn":"affiliate+marketing+splash+by+zen+duck+dave+2013.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"056496ad68097e08394bfdec720d00e7f15c5d04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,100,150,173,104,9,126,8,57,75,253,236,114,13,0,231,241,92,93,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
