Afterwards, Joe gets drunk, and goes to a bar owned by his friend Chucky (Michael Imperioli), who refuses him entry because he's intoxicated. While stuck outside, he spots a woman with a yellow umbrella, before being knocked unconscious.\nHe awakens in an isolated hotel room and finds he is a prisoner. His captors provide him with basic hygiene items and meager portions of Chinese food. Through the TV, Joe hears that he has been framed for the rape and murder of his ex-wife and that his daughter, Mia, has been adopted. After being prevented from committing suicide, Joe obsessively spends the next 20 years planning his revenge, becoming a skilled boxer by watching televised matches, and compiling a list of everyone who might be responsible for his imprisonment, with Newcombe being the prime suspect.\nIn 2013, Joe watches an adult Mia being interviewed by a TV show called &quot;Unresolved Mysteries of Crime&quot;, and claiming she'd be willing to forgive him if he returns. Suddenly, he is drugged and awakes in a box in a field, with money and a cellphone. He spots the woman with the yellow umbrella, whom he chases to a nearby clinic; there he meets Marie Sebastian (Elizabeth Olsen), a nurse who offers to help him. Joe refuses help but takes her card. He later visits Chucky and tells him what happened. He receives a mocking phone call from the mastermind behind his imprisonment, The Stranger (Sharlto Copley). After learning Newcombe died in a plane crash, Joe investigates the other names on his list, and learns they are all innocent. He eventually passes out from undernourishment, and Chucky calls Marie, who gives Joe medical treatment.\nMarie reads the letters Joe has written for Mia and offers to help him. With her, Joe is able to locate the restaurant that provided the food he was given in captivity and follows a man who arrives to take a large order to an abandoned factory, which is where he was held captive. Joe confronts the owner, Chaney (Samuel L. Jackson), and tortures him into giving him a taped conversation in which he discusses the terms of Joe's imprisonment with The Stranger. Joe is then forced to fight off all of Chaney's men, getting stabbed in the back. Joe then returns to Chucky's bar, where he meets The Stranger himself and his bodyguard Haeng-Bok, the woman with the yellow umbrella, who has kidnapped Mia.\nThe Stranger claims that if Joe is able to discover his real identity and his motives for imprisoning Joe, he will not only release Mia but also give Joe $20 million in diamonds and commit suicide. After The Stranger leaves, Joe rushes to Marie's house and saves her from Chaney and his men. Marie digitally identifies The Stranger's ringtone as being the theme song of Joe's college, and, through a yearbook, Joe is able to determine that The Stranger's real name is Adrian Pryce. Back when they were classmates, Joe saw Adrian's sister Amanda having sex with an older man and mentioned it to many students at the college. The man was later revealed to be Adrian and Amanda's father, who was having incestuous relationships with them both. After this exposure of his actions, Adrian's father murdered his wife and Amanda, attempted to murder Adrian, and then committed suicide. Adrian, the sole survivor, blamed Joe and swore revenge against him.\nJoe hides Marie in a motel, where they have sex, while Adrian finds and kills Chucky. Joe later goes to Adrian's penthouse and kills Haeng-Bok. Adrian congratulates Joe on discovering the truth. Then Adrian reveals to Joe that &quot;Mia&quot; is actually an actress on his payroll and that Joe's real daughter is Marie. Horrified by what Adrian has engineered him to do, Joe begs for death, but Adrian instead gives him the diamonds and, having exacted his revenge, commits suicide. Joe writes Marie a letter, stating they can never meet again, and leaves her all but a few of the diamonds, which he gives to Chaney in exchange for returning to captivityÃ¢â‚¬â€supposedly for the rest of his life.\n\nEnjoy !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efe09e38c1bc58946a433234691b7d8f715dec08","amp;dn":"Oldboy+2013.1080p.BluRay.x264+.+NVEE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efe09e38c1bc58946a433234691b7d8f715dec08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,224,158,56,193,188,88,148,106,67,50,52,105,27,125,143,113,93,236,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
