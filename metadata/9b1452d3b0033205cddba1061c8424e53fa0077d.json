But if the Agency Director- the man who raised her, trained her, and made Talia who she is- canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have her, he wants her eliminated. Now those she once considered friends are bona fide enemies, ruthless in their pursuit of her.\n\nTalia aligns herself with Ian Crane, the man sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d always believed was responsible for her parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ murders. With CraneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forces at her disposal, Talia sets off on her most personal mission yet: rescuing the love of her life from the Agency. But she never imagines that going after him will plunge the nation into chaos.\n\nRetribution for the lives of her parents is no longer enough for Talia. She wants justice for every innocent affected by the AgencyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greed. But she soon realizes she is actually at the center of two wars- one with them and one with herself.\n\nTalia can no longer trust the one thing that has never failed her. Her Talents are growing stronger by the day and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s already losing control. Defeating the Agency will save countless lives, but triumph over the manufactured power within her will preserve her sanity.\n\nThe Agency will stop at nothing to perpetuate their propaganda- that the Coalition is the enemy.\n\nCrane will do anything to expose the truth- that the Agency has been creating Talents for decades.\n\nHer world, her life, her future with the only person who remains trueÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ the Agency stole everything. Now, Talia will sacrifice the little she has left to reclaim whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hers. \nGenre: Science Fiction ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b1452d3b0033205cddba1061c8424e53fa0077d","amp;dn":"Created+%28Talented+Saga%29+-+Davis%2C+Sophie.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b1452d3b0033205cddba1061c8424e53fa0077d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,20,82,211,176,3,50,5,205,219,161,6,28,132,36,229,63,160,7,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
