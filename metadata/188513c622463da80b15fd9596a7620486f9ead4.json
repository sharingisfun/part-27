He sees that something has fallen on their chicken house and killed two chickens, and he brings the circular object home. The next morning, Cleci reads on the news that a Sputnik is missing and might have fallen on Earth. Based on the picture of the satellite, they conclude that the object is the sputnik. AnastÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡cio sneaks out of the house with the object and goes to the bank Caixa EconÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´mica Federal to pledge the object and raise some money to repair the chicken house. However, the attendant Dorinha calls her boy-friend Nelson that works in the newspaper Tribuna da Cidade under the pseudonym Jacinto Boucha, covering the social column, and he sees the chance of a scoop that could raise his career. However, the snoopy and unethical reporter Alberto hears the conversation in an phone extension and releases the news on the front page. AnastÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡cio becomes famous and has an immediate social ascension to high society, moving to the Copacabana Palace Hotel, while the Russian, North American and French governments send their agents to Brazil to get the sputnik at any cost.\n\n\n   General\n      Complete name :O_HOMEM_DO_SPUTNIK.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 972 MiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 37mn\n      Bit rate : 1380 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 11.8 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n      IAS1 : Portugues\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Custom\n      PlayTime : 1h 37mn\n      Bit rate : 1207 Kbps\n      Width : 512 pixels\n      Height : 384 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.254\n      StreamSize : 845 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 37mn\n      Bit rate : 165 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 115 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.97 \n      Encoding settings : ABR\n\t  \n\t  Portuguese audio, English and Portuguese subpack\n\t  \n\t  IMDB: tt0191187","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:188513c622463da80b15fd9596a7620486f9ead4","amp;dn":"Homem+do+Sputinik","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"188513c622463da80b15fd9596a7620486f9ead4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,133,19,198,34,70,61,168,11,21,253,149,150,167,98,4,134,249,234,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
