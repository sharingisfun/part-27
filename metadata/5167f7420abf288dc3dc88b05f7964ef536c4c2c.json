D. Rivera\n\nBook description: Mackenzie Blanchard's life wasn't easy; never had been, never would be. She thought things were looking up when she started yet another new school her senior year. She made friends and was enjoying life the best she could. One friendship turned into something more, and just when she felt safe, things were ripped apart. Hayes Morgan had never cared about anyone but himself. He was living the life he wanted, just having fun. He never dreamed that he would fall for the new girl in school. What started out as a sweet friendship turned into something he never thought possible, until she vanished... Their paths collide a year after they last saw each other, but they are both harboring secrets.
