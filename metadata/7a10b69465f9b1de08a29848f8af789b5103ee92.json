ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also one of my favorite books as well, written by Bret Easton Ellis. Though the two media texts are completely different, the film directed by Mary Harron who co-wrote the screenplay with Guinevere Turner is brilliant! This movie made a huge star of Christian Bale who was amazing as Patrick Bateman! He played the character so neurotically and evil still maintaining huge insecurities. Plus to really be able to portray Patrick Bateman the actor had to be extremely physical which Bale pulled off brilliantly. I think he was in the best shape of his life for this film. \nThe deleted scenes included in this release are wonderful and give real insight into the film that as a viewer you were not previously aware of and introduced by the actors themselves as they saw this twisted tale of the 80ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s through their eyes. Also the TV Spots are classic!\nThe audio commentary is very impressive and uncovers a lot of backstory and behind the scenes material.\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a classic film and one of the best book to film adaptations of all time!\nSo sit back, and get ready to cringe! Enjoy this Release, and Please Seed! Thanks!

He is twenty-seven and living his own American dream. He works by day on Wall Street, earning a fortune to complement the one he was born with. At night he descends into madness, as he experiments with fear and violence.\n\nDESCRIPTION FROM BACK COVER OF DVD COVER:\nPatrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a Wall Street yuppie obsessed with success, status and style, with a stunning fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© (Reese Witherspoon). He is also a psychotic killer who rapes, murders and dismembers both strangers and acquaintances without provocation or purpose. Based on the controversial novel by Bret Easton Ellis, the film offers a sharp satire to the dark side of yuppie culture in the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“80s, while setting forth a vision that is both terrifying and chilling.\n\n\nCAST:\n-Christian Bale - Patrick Bateman\n-Willem Dafoe - Donald Kimball\n-Reese Witherspoon - Evelyn Williams\n-Samantha Mathis - Courtney Rawlinson\n-ChloÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â« Sevigny ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Jean\n-Cara Seymour ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Christie\n-Guinevere Turner ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Elizabeth\n-Justin Theroux - Timothy Bryce\n-Josh Lucas - Craig McDermott\n-Bill Sage - David Van Patten\n-Matt Ross - Luis Carruthers\n-Jared Leto - Paul Allen\n\nMEMORABLE QUOTES:\nPatrick Bateman: You're a fucking ugly bitch. I want to stab you to death, and then play around with your blood. \nPatrick Bateman: I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane? \nPatrick Bateman: There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman; some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me: only an entity, something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable... I simply am not there. \nPatrick Bateman: I have all the characteristics of a human being: blood, flesh, skin, hair; but not a single, clear, identifiable emotion, except for greed and disgust. Something horrible is happening inside of me and I don't know why. My nightly bloodlust has overflown into my days. I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy. I think my mask of sanity is about to slip. \nPatrick Bateman: Do you know what Ed Gein said about women? \nDavid Van Patten: The maitre 'd at Canal Bar? \nPatrick Bateman: No, serial killer, Wisconsin, the '50s. \nCraig McDermott: So what did he say? \nPatrick Bateman: &quot;When I see a pretty girl walking down the street, I think two things. One part wants me to take her out, talk to her, be real nice and sweet and treat her right.&quot; \nDavid Van Patten: And what did the other part think? \nPatrick Bateman: &quot;What her head would look like on a stick... &quot; \n[laughs] \nPatrick Bateman, Craig McDermott, David Van Patten: There are no girls with good personalities. \nDavid Van Patten: A good personality consists of a chick with a little hard body, who will satisfy all sexual demands without being too slutty about things, and who essentially will keep her dumb fucking mouth shut. \nCraig McDermott: The only girls with good personalities who are smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or talented, though god knows what the fuck that means, are ugly chicks. \nDavid Van Patten: Absolutely. \nCraig McDermott: And this is because they have to make up for how fucking unattractive they are. \n\nPLEASE SEED!
