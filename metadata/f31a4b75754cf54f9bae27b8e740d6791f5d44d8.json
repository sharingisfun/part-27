The website focuses on independent filmmaking and film and video game reviews by Rolfe, and primarily hosts the web shows The Angry Video Game Nerd and Board James. The website was launched in 2000.\n\nMonster Madness (2007Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent) - a web series in which Rolfe celebrates the Halloween season by reviewing one horror film (or more) on each day of October. The series has inspired Disneycember, in which fellow reviewer Doug Walker looks at the majority of Disney's animated and computer-animated films. The marathon first began in October 2007, and has continued annually ever since. The original thirty-one reviews followed the history of horror films. The second marathon featured the entries in the Godzilla franchise, and the third marathon returned to basics, reviewing horror films. The fourth marathon was a series of reviews of cult horror films, the fifth followed the Frankenstein (film series), Hammer Dracula, A Nightmare on Elm Street, and Halloween franchises. The sixth rendition focused on horror films produced in the 1980s, and was cut short to only sixteen reviews rather than thirty-one due to the production of Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie. The seventh marathon followed the Mummy, Hammer Frankenstein, Gamera, Alien, and Dead franchises.\n\nThese were taken from Cinemassacre.com via rtmpdump and converted to mkv container via mkvmerge","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f31a4b75754cf54f9bae27b8e740d6791f5d44d8","amp;dn":"Cinemassacre%27s+Monster+Madness+%282007+-+2014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f31a4b75754cf54f9bae27b8e740d6791f5d44d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,26,75,117,117,76,245,79,155,174,39,184,231,64,214,121,31,93,68,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
