The documentary reviews both the footage and media available to the public at the time of the missions, as well as NASA films and materials which had not been opened in over 30 years. All of this has been sourced and remastered in HD by the stock footage company Footagevault. Augmenting the archival audio and video are contemporary interviews with some surviving Apollo era astronauts, including Al Bean, Michael Collins, Buzz Aldrin, John Young, David Scott, Charlie Duke, Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt. The former astronauts have the only speaking roles in the movie, although occasional supplementary information is presented on screen with text and archival television footage presents the words of journalists such as Jules Bergman and Walter Cronkite. Neil Armstrong, the first person to set foot on the Moon, declined to participate, the only surviving moon walker to do so.\n\nThe documentary shares its name with a book by space historians Colin Burgess and Francis French, and both include many original interviews with Apollo lunar astronauts. The documentary offers a view of the Apollo program that is complementary to the book and is neither a source nor a tie-in.\n\nCategory:BDRip\nFormat:MKV\nVideo codec:H.264\nAudio codec:DTS,AC3\nVideo:1280x720 at 23.976 fps, &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;94eca6a2a0d4d8a0baa5&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;, 2pass, ~7000 kbps avg, 0.317 b/px\nAudio 1:Eng 48 kHz, DTS, 3/2 (L,C,R,l,r) + LFE ch, ~1536.00 kbps avg\nAudio 2:Eng 48 kHz, AC3, 2/0 (L,R) ch, ~192.00 kbps av\nSubtitles:Greek","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bdf654493e5aab3cc7cf8b461a8dfed424f2383","amp;dn":"In+the+Shadow+of+the+Moon%282007%29.720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bdf654493e5aab3cc7cf8b461a8dfed424f2383","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,223,101,68,147,229,170,179,204,124,248,180,97,168,223,237,66,79,35,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
