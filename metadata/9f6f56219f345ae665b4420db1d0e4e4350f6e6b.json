Frankie is so far the least successful salesperson at the local car dealership, a job she explains she took only after the dentist office she worked in closed down.\nAxl, the oldest, is her rebellious teenage son and was conceived with Guns N' Roses playing a significant role. He usually appears at home wearing only boxer shorts and regards any task or chore asked of him to be an enormous imposition. A handsome and confident teen, he is a school star athlete but struggles academically. Sue, the middle child and only daughter, wears braces, part of the reason for her almost neurotic self-consciousness. She attempts to cure this by frequently trying to join school organizations, but consistently fails. Because of this she has developed amazing resilience. Brick, the youngest child, is a very bright but socially awkward seven-year-old, who was given a &quot;cool name&quot; in the vain hope that he would develop into an equally cool kid.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i650.photobucket.com/albums/uu229/GiovanniAdamo/love-sucks-poster.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i650.photobucket.com/albums/uu229/GiovanniAdamo/love-sucks-poster.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Card :.\n\nGenre: Teen drama, Supernatural, Horror\nDeveloped by: Series: Kevin Williamson, Julie Plec; Novels: L.J.
