The second half, released after the success of the first, makes up Serenity, is the more upbeat and driving material.\n\nBoth are essential Getz items.Not just great live albums, but great albums in their own right.\n\n\n- 2CDs\n- 320Kbps \n\n\nAnniversary, 1989:\n1. El Cahon\n2. I CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Get Started\n3. Stella By Starlight\n4. StanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Blues\n5. I Thought About You\n6. What Is This Thing Called Love\n7. Blood Count\n\n\nSerenity, 1991:\n1. On Green Dolphin Street\n2. Voyage\n3. Falling In Love\n4. I Remember You\n5. I Love You\n\n\nPersonnel:\nStan Getz, tenor saxophone\nKenny Barron, piano\nRufus Reid, bass\nVictor Lewis, drums\n\n\nOriginally recorded for Denmark Radio at the Cafe Montmartre Jazzhus, Copenhagen, Denmark on July 6, 1987\n\n\n \nP.S.\nStan Getz had not heard the classic Ellington-Hodges recording of BLOOD COUNT from August 1967, and had never played it until the Pure Getz session in 1982. \nYet Getz outdid Hodges and pretty much owned the tune from that point on.\n\nIn May 1987, about two years after he had conquered his alcohol and drug addictions, Getz learned that he himself had cancer. BLOOD COUNT had thus taken on an added underlying significance when Getz performed it brilliantly two months later at the Montmartre Club, as heard here. \n\nAs Getz said shortly before his death in 1991, \nI think about Strayhorn when I play the song. You can hear him dying. When it's in a minor key, you can hear the man talking to God.\n\n\n\nAt 320Kbps for you, Sir or Madam\nStan Getz, a nice bunch of guys\n:)Ã¯ï¿½Å \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:decfaf2cbc6c8011d74d23e9a58400cf0dd49116","amp;dn":"Stan+Getz+-+Anniversary+1989+%26amp%3B+Serenity+1991","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"decfaf2cbc6c8011d74d23e9a58400cf0dd49116","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,207,175,44,188,108,128,17,215,77,35,233,165,132,0,207,13,212,145,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
