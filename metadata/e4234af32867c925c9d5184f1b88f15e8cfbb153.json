They are Indigo Prime. And they have a problem.\n\nThis new collection for the UK and Ireland includes Dead Eyes, the story that took readers by surprise as it brought back SmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mind-bending world of dimension engineers, routine apocalypses, and visceral horror after more than a decadeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s absence from the pages of 2000 AD. Smith teams up with fellow Cradlegrave creator Edmund Bagwell and Lee Carter (Judge Dredd), to reveal a multiverse in which every reality all seems familiar, and yet .... different. With breathtakingly epic artwork and a cover from Chris Weston (The Twelve), Indigo Prime: Anthropocalypse is a gateway to an infinite number of new worlds and a perfect introduction to one of 2000 ADÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most imaginative series","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4234af32867c925c9d5184f1b88f15e8cfbb153","amp;dn":"Indigo+Prime+-+Anthropocalypse+%28collected+from+2000AD%29+%28-+Nem+-%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4234af32867c925c9d5184f1b88f15e8cfbb153","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,35,74,243,40,103,201,37,201,213,24,79,27,136,241,94,140,251,177,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
