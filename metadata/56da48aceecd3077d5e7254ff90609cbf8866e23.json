Fresh Paint\nTriumph turns to humiliation when a high-stakes take-down of a suspect goes awry. Andy McNally has made a critical rookie mistake, ruining a long-running undercover drug sting, and tries to make up for it by going face to face with a volatile gunman who already has one man's blood on his hands.\n02. Mercury Retrograde\nAs the other rookies attempt to hunt down a violent escaped convict, Andy gets a lesson in the dangers of undercover work when she and her training officer, Detective Sam Swarek, search for a missing informant whose cover has been blown. Swarek's rogue tactics on the job aren't all that Andy finds troubling -- there's also a surprising, undeniable attraction between the two of them.\n03. Fite Nite\nWhile other rookies get ready to duke it out at the police department's annual &quot;Fight Night&quot; charity event, Andy wrestles with a dilemma of her own: Should she keep a promise to protect a domestic abuse victim who has been repeatedly let down by the system - even if it means breaking police protocol to do the right thing?\n\nCountry of origin: Canada\nDuration: approxemately 60 minutes\nCreated/ Directed by: Tassie Cameron, Morwyn Brebner, Ellen Vanstone\nCast: Missy Peregrym, Gregory Smith and Enuka Okuma\nFile extension and size: Video_TS folder. The original used to be an .ISO file, but I noticed it wouldn't play the menu. So I unpacked it with 7-zip and made a video_TS folder of it. This way there are no problems with the menu and dvd.\nAudio: English 5.1 and 2.0\nSubtitles: Dutch retail\nCategory: Series\nSource: Retail\nMenu: Yes\nExtras: No\nGenre: Crime ~ Drama\nWeblink: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1442065/\nYouTube: \n\nVideo and audio information:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFormat            : MPEG-PS at 5 027 Kbps\nLength            : 1 024 MiB for 28mn 28s 800ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG Video at 4 479 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 576 (1.778) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 448 Kbps\nInfos             : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nKom ook eens kijken op ons gezellige forum: &lt;a href=&quot; http://black-sam.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://black-sam.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56da48aceecd3077d5e7254ff90609cbf8866e23","amp;dn":"Rookie+Blue+S1D1+%28Retail+DD5.1+NL+Subs%29+Hornigold+TBS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56da48aceecd3077d5e7254ff90609cbf8866e23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,218,72,172,238,205,48,119,213,231,37,79,249,6,9,203,248,134,110,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
