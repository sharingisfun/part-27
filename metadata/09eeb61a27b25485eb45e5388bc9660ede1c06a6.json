Lennox was educated at Oxford, Cambridge, and the University of Wales and is a Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford and Fellow in Mathematics and Philosophy of Science at Green College. Dr. Lennox came to Birmingham in 2007 to debate Prof. Richard Dawkins at the &quot;God Delusion&quot; Debate. &quot;It is the very nature of science that leads me to belief in God,&quot; he says. He recently published GodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Undertaker: Has Science Buried God? which seeks to explore this claim.\n\nChristopher Hitchens went to school at Balliol College in Oxford, where he read Philosophy, Politics, and Economics. He joined the Labour Party as soon as he was eligible, in 1965. He became a correspondent for the magazine International Socialism, which was published by the International Socialists, the forerunners of today's British Socialist Workers Party. In the 1970s he went on to work for the New Statesman and after immigrating to the United States in 1981 wrote for The Nation. Hitchens is an atheist and antitheist, and he describes himself as a believer in the Enlightenment values of secularism, humanism, and reason. He currently resides in Washington D.C. and has been a columnist at numerous places, but recently his book, God is Not Great, has made him a staple of talk shows and lecture circuits.\n\nIs God Great? will pit these two authors and spokes-persons against each other in what is sure to be a lively debate.\n\nThis special edition torrent includes a scanned copy of Christopher Hitchens' debate notes for debate technique analysis.\n\nThis debate was hosted by the Samford Socratic Club on 3/3/2009.\n\nIt was filmed in Birmingham, Alabama. (one long white-sheet toga party with burning crosses in the lawns crackling merrily in the night breeze.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09eeb61a27b25485eb45e5388bc9660ede1c06a6","amp;dn":"Christopher+Hitchens+vs.+John+Lennox%2C+Is+God+Great+Debate+3%2F2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09eeb61a27b25485eb45e5388bc9660ede1c06a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,238,182,26,39,178,84,133,235,69,229,56,139,201,102,14,222,28,6,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
