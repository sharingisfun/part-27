McGilchrist draws on a vast body of recent research in neuroscience and psychology  to reveal that the difference is profound: the left hemisphere is detail oriented, while the right has greater breadth, flexibility, and generosity. McGilchrist then takes the reader on a journey through the history of Western culture, illustrating the tension between these two worlds as revealed in the thought and belief of thinkers and artists from Aeschylus to Magritte. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Master-His-Emissary-Divided/dp/0300188374&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Master-His-Emissary-Divided/dp/0300188374&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d365f15d82b2333b22981ec6c00924db56a4bb9","amp;dn":"The+Master+and+His+Emissary%3A+The+Divided+Brain+and+the+Making+of","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d365f15d82b2333b22981ec6c00924db56a4bb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,54,95,21,216,43,35,51,178,41,129,236,108,0,146,77,181,106,75,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
