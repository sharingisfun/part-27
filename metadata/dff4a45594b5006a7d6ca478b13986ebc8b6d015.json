With a back to basics ethic, the DR1 control interface is intuitive and simple, and free of clutter. Dual Lo- and Hi-pass filter pads and resonant oscillator phasing generate fat electro bass sounds and synth leads.\n\nInspired by, and tested alongside, vintage analogue hardware (from Moog, Octave, Polivoks) the DR1 doesn't claim to emulate a particular synth but has its own classic sound - proven live on club sound systems (at Arena Berlin and The Loft in Barcelona) and on recent output from Soma Records and DS93 (the vinyl-exclusive label of Techno pioneers The Black Dog).\n\nFeatures:\n\n* 2 Oscillators with Sub.\n* 4 notes polyphonic.\n* Lo- and Hi-Pass filters (X-Y pads control both cutoff and resonance simultaneously).\n* 64 presets by Vector Lovers.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nOS: Microsoft Windows XP (or later)\nRAM: 512MB\nCPU: 1GHz\nVST Compatible host application\n\nInstallation:\n\nExtract to VST plugin directory.\n\nURL: http://www.drdrone.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dff4a45594b5006a7d6ca478b13986ebc8b6d015","amp;dn":"DR1+Dr.Drone+v0.2b+VSTi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dff4a45594b5006a7d6ca478b13986ebc8b6d015","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,244,164,85,148,181,0,106,125,108,164,120,177,57,134,235,200,182,208,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
