It provides a radically new high-productivity programming model that promotes cleaner code architecture, test-driven development, and powerful extensibility, combined with all the benefits of ASP.NET 4.\n\nIn this, the third edition, the core model-view-controller (MVC) architectural concepts are not simply explained or discussed in isolation, but are demonstrated in action. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll work through an extended tutorial to create a working e-commerce web application that combines ASP.NET MVC with the latest C# language features and unit-testing best practices. By gaining this invaluable, practical experience, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll discover MVCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s strengths and weaknesses for yourselfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and put your best-learned theory into practice.\n\nThe book's authors, Steve Sanderson and Adam Freeman, have both watched the growth of ASP.NET MVC since its first release. Steve is a well known blogger on the MVC Framework and a member of the Microsoft Web Platform and Tools team.
