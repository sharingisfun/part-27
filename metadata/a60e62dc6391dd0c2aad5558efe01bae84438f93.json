With more fractured textures that combine horns, flutes, string swells and arpeggiated guitars, the opening of the EP finds Jens in constant state of transition, musically, as well. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a60e62dc6391dd0c2aad5558efe01bae84438f93","amp;dn":"Jens+Lekman+-+An+Argument+with+Myself+%5Bmp3-vbr-2011%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a60e62dc6391dd0c2aad5558efe01bae84438f93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,14,98,220,99,145,221,12,42,173,85,88,239,224,27,174,132,67,143,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
