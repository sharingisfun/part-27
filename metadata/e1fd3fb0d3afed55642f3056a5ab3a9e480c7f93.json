Adam Tooze's controversial new book challenges the conventional economic interpretations of that period to explore how Hitler's surprisingly prescient vision- ultimately hindered by Germany's limited resources and his own racial ideology-was to create a German super-state to dominate Europe and compete with what he saw as America's overwhelming power in a soon-to- be globalized world. The Wages of Destruction is a chilling work of originality and tremendous scholarship that is already setting off debate in Germany and will fundamentally change the way in which history views the Second World War","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1fd3fb0d3afed55642f3056a5ab3a9e480c7f93","amp;dn":"The+Wages+of+Destruction%3A+The+Making+and+Breaking+of+the+Nazi+Ec","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1fd3fb0d3afed55642f3056a5ab3a9e480c7f93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,253,63,176,211,175,237,85,100,47,48,86,165,171,58,158,72,12,127,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
