It reached No. 1 on the R&amp;B chart, No. 6 on Billboard's Pop Singles chart,[citation needed] and number one on the UK Singles Chart. The song was ranked #307 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nThe song helped to make Frankie Lymon a household name and would make him a rock and roll pioneer, paving the way for later teen prodigies like Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson, whose careers also took off at the age of 13.\n\nDiana Ross released a cover version on the RCA label in 1981, peaking at #7 on Billboard's Pop Singles Chart, and number four in the UK Singles Chart. The success of Ross' cover helped reintroduce a new generation of audiences to Lymon[dubious ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ discuss]. A remix of Ross' cover peaked at #36 on the UK charts in July, 1994.\n\nWhy Do Fools Fall in Love is a 1981 album released by American singer Diana Ross on the RCA label.\n\nIt was the first album she recorded without Motown, having left the label earlier that year to sign a $20 million dollar deal with RCA. The album was also the first to be produced by the singer, which became her second RIAA-certified platinum album after diana. Among the hits on the album include the title track, the rock-flavored &quot;Mirror Mirror&quot; and the '80s-aerobics-craze inspired, &quot;Work That Body&quot;. A solo version of Ross' Lionel Richie duet, &quot;Endless Love&quot;, is also featured. The duet version of &quot;Endless Love&quot;, was number one un the USA ( where it spent 9 weeks at the peak of the charts, selling over 2 millions copies and becoming one of the best selling singles 80's ), in Australia, in Canada and in South Africa.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:998a19b0ac2d082f24e60e103ba10432834d0563","amp;dn":"Diana+Ross+-+Why+Do+Fools+Fall+In+Love+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"998a19b0ac2d082f24e60e103ba10432834d0563","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,138,25,176,172,45,8,47,36,230,14,16,59,161,4,50,131,77,5,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
