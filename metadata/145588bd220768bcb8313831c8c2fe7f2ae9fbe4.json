At various times over the years, I've heard and enjoyed all of these pioneers of Christian music.  And I can't begin to imagine we'd have artists today like MercyMe, Matthew West, Paul Baloche, etc without the contributions of those artists from many years ago.  So from my modest collection of 1956, now to yours, enjoy today's modest bundle from 1956.\n\nThere are 6 albums being shared today, including...\n\n * Aretha Franklin - 1956 - Aretha Gospel\n * Blackwood Brothers - 1956 - His Hands\n * Chris Barber - 1956 - In Concert, Vol 1\n * Louvin Brothers - 1956 - Tragic Songs Of Life\n * Sam Cooke - 1956 - Complete Specialty Recordings - With The Soul Stirrers\n * Sister Rosetta Tharpe - 1956 - Gospel Train\n\nFor Him,\nTorrentTracts, May 2014\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:145588bd220768bcb8313831c8c2fe7f2ae9fbe4","amp;dn":"1956+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+01%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"145588bd220768bcb8313831c8c2fe7f2ae9fbe4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,85,136,189,34,7,104,188,184,49,56,49,200,194,254,127,42,233,251,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
