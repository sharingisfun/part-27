This process has taken many, many hours of \ncareful listening and selection, as many notes intended by the artist could be \nmistaken for noise on a spectogram.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHal Blaine, then.\n   Each time I meet him he puts me uptight, and this is my fault and certainly not \nhis, and probably stems from the fact that he believes in himself and his ability \n(which is considerable) whereas there are times when I do not - believe in myself,\nI should add because Hal is a man one respects. Or should.\n   I usually see him in the studio which is where most of us see him for he's there \nfrom morning to morning without sleep, food, sustenance, spiritual encouragement and often thanks, which he deserves because he's the finest drummer in the country, \ncontinent and possibly the world.\n   In his little study within the massive Blaine mansion (he's rich, married, and \nhappily domesticated when separated from his drums) the walls present an \nillustrious collage of musical history. There is a picture of Hal standing with \nBasie, an autographed portrait of the Beach Boys expressing thanks for services \nrendered, and an abundance of Gold Records (one of the more honest status symbols \nin pop) on which his drum sound - an unusual, tight, thick sound which has become \nsomething of a hallmark - has played an integral role.\n   So. Blaine is best. He knows it and so should you and he will tell you with \nsupreme self-confidence and justifiable pride.\n   People should know that Blaine beats his skins for Frank Sinatra. They should\nknow that his sound has been heard on over a hundred million-selling records. They\nshould know that if the Mamas &amp; Papas cannot get Blaine for a session, then there \nis no session and they'll cancel their studio tie at great personal expense.\nArtists want the best, and the best is Blaine.\n   This is a beautiful album. The music here constitutes a mind-excursion of rare \nbeauty, and semantically is therefore psychedelic. But I would like to think it is \nmore likely to start a trend than to catch one. And then, perhaps, we will have the \nbenefit of Hal Blaine in concert, Hal Blaine on the tube, and Hal Blaine on the \nairwaves.\n   Percussion genius - you are on.\n                                                  ANDY WICKHAM\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSide &quot;A&quot;\n\n1) Love-In (December)......................2:18\n2) Freaky (January)........................2:23\n3) Flashes (February)......................2:23\n4) Kaleidoscope (March)....................2:20\n5) Hallucinations (April)..................2:23\n6) Flower Society (May)....................2:27\n\n\nSide &quot;B&quot;\n\n1) Trippin' Out (June).....................2:36\n2) Tune In-Turn On (July)..................2:14\n3) Vibrations (August).....................2:15\n4) Soulful (September).....................2:21\n5) Inner-Space (October)...................2:18\n6) Wiggy (November)........................2:12\n\n\nAll selections published by Trousdale Music Publishers, Inc.
