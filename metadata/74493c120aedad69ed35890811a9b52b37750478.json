The Legacy starts out at the legendary manor GrÃƒÂ¸nnegaard, where the internationally renowned artist Veronika GrÃƒÂ¸nnegaard has lived an eccentric and colorful life since the wild sixties. The serial follows Veronika's four adult children whose free and chaotic childhood at GrÃƒÂ¸nnegaard has left its mark on them in very different ways. They live scattered to the four winds until Veronika unexpectedly dies and they are forced to gather to wind up the estate. Just before she dies, Veronika leaves the manor to her daughter Signe, who was given up for adoption. Signe lives with her partner in a quiet residential area in the local town and has never known the truth of her parentage. What was meant to be a quick and painless estate division becomes the start of a journey into secrets and lies that turn their lives upside down and forces them to look at each other and themselves with new eyes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74493c120aedad69ed35890811a9b52b37750478","amp;dn":"Arvingerne+%28The+Legacy%29+-+Complete+Season+1+%2B+ENG+subtitles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74493c120aedad69ed35890811a9b52b37750478","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,73,60,18,10,237,173,105,237,53,137,8,17,169,181,43,55,117,4,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
