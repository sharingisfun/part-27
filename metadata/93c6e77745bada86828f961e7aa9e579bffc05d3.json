The fittest have indeed survived--even in places where no living creatures could be thought to exist. \n\nIn a stunning six-part miniseries, Nature presents a compelling new vision of the epic forces that have shaped the Earth. More than three years in the making, &quot;Triumph of Life&quot; combines dramatic storytelling with powerful, ground-breaking scientific ideas in a sweeping story about survival and the survivors--the winners, for the moment at least, in an eternal battle.\n\nThis drive to survive has produced remarkable hunting strategies, from frogs that are able to snare flying insects with long, elastic tongues, to cheetahs that work together to chase down fleet gazelles. But it has also shaped magnificent survival skills. Some moths, for instance, can sense a batÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s prey-seeking sonar pulses, and duck just in time to avoid the onrushing batÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s jaws.\n\nOther animals have taken to deception, evolving colors and body shapes that provide perfect camouflage, making them invisible to predators. Some octopuses featured on THE ETERNAL ARMS RACE, for instance, can make themselves look just like poisonous sea snakes. \n\nStill other animals have taken the opposite tack, covering themselves in bright, outrageous colors that make it impossible for them to hide, but advertise the fact they can be distasteful or poisonous to eat. In the competition between hunter and hunted, no new tactic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ from thicker armor or sharper teeth to better vision and hearing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is left untried. But only the successful traits ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ those that either let a predator catch more prey or allow the prey to survive attack ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ get passed along to the next generation. Meanwhile, the ultimately unsuccessful adaptations get left behind on evolutionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s battlefield, victims of lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s eternal arms race.\n\n\n\n\nProduced by: David Heeley &amp; Suzanne Weinert\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nTitle: Triumph Of Life-The Eternal Arms Race\nYear:  2001\nFile Size: 741 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:52:31\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Resolution: 720x384\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1927 kbit/s\nFPS:  29.970000\nAudio Bitrate: 192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: (AC3)\nChannels:  2 \nSubtitles: (External English)\n \n\n  \n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\nNote: External English subtitle included.\n-----------------------------------------\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤\n\nSPECIAL NOTE: I have reached the totaly ammount of bandwidth at my regular image \n-------------\n              site AGAIN.
