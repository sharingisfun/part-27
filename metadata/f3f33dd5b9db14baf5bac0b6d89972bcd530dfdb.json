Pre-calculus by itself deepens your understanding of mathematics and improves your performance on standardized pre-college and college tests. Now anyone can master pre-calculus -- without formal training, unlimited time, or a genius IQ. In Pre-Calculus Demystified, best-selling author and teacher Rhonda Huettenmueller breaks pre-calculus down into manageable bites with practical examples, solutions, graphs, practice questions, and a fresh approach that removes the mystery from pre-calc concepts.\n\nUnlike most books on pre-calculus, general concepts are presented first -- and the details follow. In order to make the process as clear and simple as possible, long computations are presented in a logical, layered progression with just one execution per step.\n\nThis entertaining self-teaching course makes it fun and easy to learn precalculus fast. Get ready to:\n\n    * Perform better on placement exams\n    * Avoid confusion with detailed examples and solutions that help you every step of the way\n    * Conquer such topics as absolute value, nonlinear inequalities, inverses, trigonometric functions, and conic sections.\n    * Get comfortable with functions, graphs of functions, logarithms, exponents, and more\n    * Master a subject that will help you with calculus, geometry, trigonometry, physics, chemistry, computing, and engineering\n    * Reinforce learning and pinpoint weaknesses with questions at the end of every chapter, and a final exam at the end of the book\n\nPre-Calculus Demystified is the perfect shortcut to learning or brushing up on this important subject.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 468 pages\n    * Publisher: McGraw-Hill Professional; 1 edition (January 14, 2005)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0071439277\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0071439275","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3f33dd5b9db14baf5bac0b6d89972bcd530dfdb","amp;dn":"Pre+Calculus+Demystified%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3f33dd5b9db14baf5bac0b6d89972bcd530dfdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,243,61,213,185,219,20,186,245,186,192,182,216,153,114,188,213,48,223,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
