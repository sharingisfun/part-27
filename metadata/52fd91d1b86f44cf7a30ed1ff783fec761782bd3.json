Investigators in diverse fields discuss their findings on indirect calorimetry, energy requirements and storage, neurohormonal and muscle tissue influences on thermogenesis, and cellular energy expenditure. Emphasis is placed on linking concepts of nutritional support, nitrogen balance, and weight loss with current knoweldge of cellular energetics and energy balance. The book provides a scientific foundation for major advances in the therapeutic use of clinical nutrition based on application of appropriate fuel mixes and substrates to sustain metabolism and cellular function","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52fd91d1b86f44cf7a30ed1ff783fec761782bd3","amp;dn":"Energy+Metabolism+-+Tissue+Determinants+and+Cellular+Corollaries","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52fd91d1b86f44cf7a30ed1ff783fec761782bd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,253,145,209,184,111,68,207,122,48,237,31,247,131,254,199,97,120,43,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
