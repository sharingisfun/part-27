It's like IP Messenger and is based on the TCP/IP protocol. You can chat and share files among computers that have Mac, Windows or Linux provided this is installed on each. It works on LAN as well as internet also, to the best of my knowledge, but certainly on LAN.\n\nCurrently I don't have a serial for this but keygens and serials for the Windows version are freely available and I'd be grateful if someone can post a few serials here as a comment. I think they should work. I hope you find this useful.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cf8268e4212255fb8c0be66fb4d08497e84b581","amp;dn":"Outlook+LAN+messenger+V2+for+Mac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cf8268e4212255fb8c0be66fb4d08497e84b581","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,248,38,142,66,18,37,95,184,192,190,102,251,77,8,73,126,132,181,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
