But when Mikey stumbles upon a treasure map of the famed &quot;One-Eyed&quot; Willy's hidden fortune, Mikey, Brandon, and their friends Lawrence &quot;Chunk&quot; Cohen, Clark &quot;Mouth&quot; Devereaux, Andrea &quot;Andy&quot; Carmichael, Stefanie &quot;Stef&quot; Steinbrenner, and Richard &quot;Data&quot; Wang, calling themselves The Goonies, set out on a quest to find the treasure in hopes of saving their neighborhood. The treasure is in a cavern, but the entrance to the cavern is under the house of evil thief Mama Fratelli and her sons Jake Fratelli, Francis Fratelli, and the severely disfigured Lotney &quot;Sloth&quot; Fratelli. Sloth befriends the Goonies and decides to help them.\n\n\n\n***** As Always, My Thanks in advance to those who stay on to seed after their download has been completed it is much appreciated *****\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089218&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089218&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09b5e1a6c5527c4b31074ec1e536a2c196375585","amp;dn":"The+Goonies+-+Multi+Audio+%26amp%3B+Subs+%28See+Post%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09b5e1a6c5527c4b31074ec1e536a2c196375585","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,181,225,166,197,82,124,75,49,7,78,193,229,54,162,193,150,55,85,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
