The authors not only present the subject of Brownian motion as a dry part of mathematical analysis, but convey its real meaning and fascination. The opening, heuristic chapter does just this, and it is followed by a comprehensive and self-contained account of the foundations of theory of stochastic processes. Chapter 3 is a lively presentation of the theory of Markov processes. Together with its companion volume, this book equips graduate students for research into a subject of great intrinsic interest and wide applications.\n\n-Classic book, first time in paperback\n-Intuitive and rigorous so suited for graduate students and non-experts\n-Comprehensive and up-to-date\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSome frequently used notation\n1.
