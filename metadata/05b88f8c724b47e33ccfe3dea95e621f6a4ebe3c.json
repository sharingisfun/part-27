It made sense at that\ntime for local people to select one responsible person who would travel periodically to meet\nwith other similar representatives to pass new laws and approve corresponding taxes. \n\nBut now we have the internet, which could allow participation in decision making\nby a wider body of people. On the good side, diffusing decision making authority makes\nit harder to bribe anyone.  On the bad side, diffusing decision making authority means\nyou have to educate and convince a much wider set of people of a worthwhile idea before\nit can be implemented.\n\nI suggest that the legislature should be expanded to include perhaps 100,000 people,\nall interconnected and participing using the internet.  Pay for participation\nshould be nominal.  In all cases, it should be a part-time commitment.  Nobody in the \nlegislature should have an &quot;occupation&quot; as a politician, their occupation should be \nsomething productive.\n\n-- freeflow123\n\nThis release covers... \n\nA Passage to India\nA Perfect Day for Bananafish\nA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\nA Prayer for Owen Meany\nA Raisin in the Sun\nA Room of One's Own\nA Room with a View\nA Rose for Emily\nA Separate Peace\nA Small Place\nA Streetcar Named Desire\nAn Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\nNarrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass\nNative Son\nNausea\nNectar in a Sieve\nNervous Conditions\nNight\nNisa?
