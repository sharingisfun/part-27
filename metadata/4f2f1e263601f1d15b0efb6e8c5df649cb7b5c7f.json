These majestic predators epitomize survival. Their story is one of opportunism and adaptation in the face of a rapidly changing ecological landscape. \r\nWe follow the unfolding story of a single breeding pair in the suburbs of Vancouver, Canada, over the course of a year. Via the social media phenomena known as 'nestcams' we are able to witness their amazing lifecycle, and understand the adaptations they've made to be successful in the city.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/62/The-Eagles-Next-Door-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/77/The-Eagles-Next-Door-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f5/The-Eagles-Next-Door-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c2/The-Eagles-Next-Door-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2b/The-Eagles-Next-Door-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/15/The-Eagles-Next-Door-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/00/The-Eagles-Next-Door-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/34/The-Eagles-Next-Door-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/ba/The-Eagles-Next-Door-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/45/The-Eagles-Next-Door-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cb/The-Eagles-Next-Door-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b2/The-Eagles-Next-Door-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3125 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 45mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 984 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/episodes/eagles-next-door","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f2f1e263601f1d15b0efb6e8c5df649cb7b5c7f","amp;dn":"The+Nature+Of+Things+The+Eagles+Next+Door+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f2f1e263601f1d15b0efb6e8c5df649cb7b5c7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,47,30,38,54,1,241,209,91,14,251,110,140,93,246,73,203,123,92,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
