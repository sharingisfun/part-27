Plugins are small bits of third-party software built by companies like Adobe Systems or Apple to power videos, animation and games (examples include Flash Player or Quicktime). They can cause browser crashes or pose security risks when they get out of date, so weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve built an easy tool to help you stay current.\n- Adapt Your Interface.

Web applications like mail, video or games keep getting more awesome, but they also require additional processing power to run smoothly.
