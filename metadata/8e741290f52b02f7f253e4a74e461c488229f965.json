By night, she is someone altogether different.\n\nThe notorious Black AngelÃ¢â‚¬â€so called for her lusciously located angel\ntattooÃ¢â‚¬â€ruthlessly takes from powerful men who exploit, and gives to\nthose who suffer at their hands. Always in disguise, she has eluded\ncapture and her identity remains a mystery.\n\nThe Marquess of Devellyn, one of the least noble noblemen in town,\nuses and discards women as he pleases. But when the Black Angel\nentices him into her bed, ties him up, and pilfers his most valued\npossession, she may have gone too far. This time, Devellyn tells her,\nshe'll have the devil to pay. And he definitely means to collect.\n\nThe Devil to Pay (MacLachlan Family #1)\nby Liz Carlyle\nISBN: 0743470044\n(ISBN13: 9780743470049)\nFormat: EPUB\nLanguage: EN\nPages: 581 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e741290f52b02f7f253e4a74e461c488229f965","amp;dn":"The+Devil+to+Pay+%28MacLachlan+Family+%231%29++by+Liz+Carlyle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e741290f52b02f7f253e4a74e461c488229f965","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,116,18,144,245,43,2,247,242,83,228,167,78,70,28,72,130,41,249,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
