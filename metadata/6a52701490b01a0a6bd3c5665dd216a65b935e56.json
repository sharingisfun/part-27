He withdraws all his savings from the bank and heads to a posh hotel. Here he makes more contacts and opens more professional doors than he'd ever done before, thanks to his willingness--at long last--to take risks. He also spends every penny that he's earned in life. Then he discovers that the doctor's diagnosis was in error, and that he's in no danger of imminent death. An ironic ending caps this fast-paced black comedy. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Last Holiday.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.07 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 28mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 729 Kbps\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n      Writing library : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 28mn\n      Bit rate : 1 528 Kbps\n      Width : 624 pixels\n      Height : 464 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.220\n      Stream size : 970 MiB (88%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 28mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Channel positions : C\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 122 MiB (11%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042665/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042665/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nHenry Cass - Last Holiday (1950)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a52701490b01a0a6bd3c5665dd216a65b935e56","amp;dn":"Henry+Cass+-+Last+Holiday+%281950%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a52701490b01a0a6bd3c5665dd216a65b935e56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,82,112,20,144,176,26,10,107,211,197,102,93,210,22,166,91,147,94,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
