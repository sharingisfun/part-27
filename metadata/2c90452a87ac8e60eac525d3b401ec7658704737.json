It follows up the group's impressive 2010 debut album, Tourist History. Once again featuring the talents of singer/guitarist/programmer Alex Trimble, guitarist/singer Sam Halliday, and bassist/singer Kevin Baird, the album was produced by Jacknife Lee (U2, R.E.M., Snow Patrol) and features more of the band's '80s post-punk and new wave-influenced melodic dance rock. Set for release in the fall of 2012, Beacon features such cuts as &quot;Sleep Alone&quot; and &quot;Handshake,&quot; which were debuted live at various festivals in 2011.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c90452a87ac8e60eac525d3b401ec7658704737","amp;dn":"Two+Door+Cinema+Club+-+Beacon+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c90452a87ac8e60eac525d3b401ec7658704737","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,144,69,42,135,172,142,96,234,197,37,211,180,1,236,118,88,112,71,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
