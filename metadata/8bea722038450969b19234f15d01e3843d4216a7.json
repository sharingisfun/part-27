(The film is though)\nI personally love the first track of this album.\n\nAgain, ripped with DBpoweramp in the uncompressed lossless goodness of WAVE(no AccurateRipÃ¢â€žÂ¢ for this one, but it should be fine. Ripped it slowly and securely)\n\n&quot;One ocean once covered the world it was...Morning Of The Earth&quot;\nSoundtrack\n1972\nWAVE (.wav)\n1411kbps\n16 bit\n44.1KHz\nStereo\n\n\nTracklist:\n[5:09] 1. MORNING OF THE EARTH\n[4:04] 2. I'LL BE ALRIGHT\n[4:08] 3. FIRST THINGS FIRST\n[3:44] 4. SURE FEELS GOOD\n[3:40] 5. OPEN UP YOUR HEART\n[7:40] 6. SIMPLE BEN\n[6:12] 7. BALI WATERS\n[6:00] 8.

COME WITH ME\n\nUsed the iTunes artwork as the default, but also dropped some hi-res scans of the CD cover in there.\n\nAlso, please be patient for the first bit as I don't have the best upload bandwidth (due to location).\n\nAny problems or whatever, leave a comment. Otherwise I won't know.\n\nNOTE: last 2 tracks ripped with iTunes because they could not be ripped with DBpoweramp (old CD).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bea722038450969b19234f15d01e3843d4216a7","amp;dn":"Morning+of+the+Earth+%28CD+Rip+Original+Soundtrack%29+%5BWAVE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bea722038450969b19234f15d01e3843d4216a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,234,114,32,56,69,9,105,177,146,52,241,93,1,227,132,61,66,22,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
