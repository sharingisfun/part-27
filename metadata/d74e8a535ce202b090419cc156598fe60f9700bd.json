A collection of nine blues tunes and three popular standards, Losing Game includes one rare example of Johnson accompanying himself on piano--&quot;Evil Woman&quot;-- and a stunning guitar instrumental--&quot;Slow and Easy&quot;--on which he further developed the surprise-filled triplet patterns he'd made famous with his 1927 solo chorus on Louis Armstrong's &quot;I'm Not Rough.&quot; Not rough, indeed, Johnson was one of the smoothest, sweetest blues and jazz stylists who ever lived.\n\nSinging guitarist Lonnie Johnson looms as a major stylistic innovator in both the jazz and blues fields. His single-string approach to soloing and sophisticated harmonic sense left a profound mark on several generations of guitar players, including Eddie Lang, Charlie Christian, T-Bone Walker, Lowell Fulson, and B.B. King.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. New Orleans Blues 2:21 \n2. My Little Kitten Susie 2:34 \n3. Evil Woman 2:27 \n4. What A Diff'rence A Day Made 4:47 \n5. Moanin' Blues 3:53 \n6. Summertime 5:36 \n7.
