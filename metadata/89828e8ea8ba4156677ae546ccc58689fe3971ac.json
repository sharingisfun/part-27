Using a process similar to echolocation, you use sounds in the environment to create a mental reconstruction of the world around you. The character has not been blind since birth, and is therefore able to pull memories from their childhood to &quot;see&quot; the environment. \n\nThroughout your journey, you will encounter creatures called Mokos whose sole desire is to help you. By using the noise these creatures make, they provide additional &quot;vision&quot; when in need. They also provide superfluous amounts of cuteness. In contrast, there are also terrifying creatures who seek to devour you. Listen carefully and avoid these beasts at all costs. \n\nIn this synesthesia-like experience, your world will shift and become clearer based on the information provided by your senses. There is often a distinct difference between what you &quot;see&quot; versus what is actually there. Let your senses guide you.\n\n============================================\nKICKSTARTER                                =\n============================================\n\nKickstarter link: http://kck.st/Wx6GXD \n\nIndependent game development has come a long way since the birth of video games -- in large part due to the recent involvement of Kickstarter. It has been an incredibly positive force in allowing creativity to flow from Ã¢â‚¬Å“the little guyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and get it into the hands of players around the world.\n\nIndividually, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve all backed numerous projects on Kickstarter, and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen the amazing results. Now we're on the other end of that. We can deliver, we just need a bit of help.\n\nBy backing us, you're helping us overcome the upfront costs for development. Specifically:\n\nPurchasing the software licenses - Our prototype was created using educational software licences that were made available to us through our school. We need to purchase professional licences to move forward with the project.\n\nGame audio, studio recording and soundtrack - While at VFS we had access to an amazing sound team and recording studio. To maintain the quality level we were able to achieve in the prototype we will need access to these facilities and in the real world they don't come cheap.\n\nLegal junk - We need to get the usual legal stuff out of the way so that we are protected and can focus on the game.\n\n=============================================\nTHE DEVS!                                   =\n=============================================\n\nteampixelpi.com\n\nTeam Pixel Pi is a group of five game developers based in Vancouver, Canada. They formed the team during their time at the Game Design program at Vancouver Film School, where they created the Pulse prototype as their final student project. After graduation, the project went on to gain world-wide recognition.\n\nTeam Pixel Pi is participating in Brian Fargo's Kicking it Forward program. This means that 5% of the profit from our projects will go towards pledging and supporting other Kickstarter projects.\n\n============================================\nInstructions:                              =\n============================================\n\n1.
