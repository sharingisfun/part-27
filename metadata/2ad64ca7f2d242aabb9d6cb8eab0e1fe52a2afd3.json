How exactly did Europe &quot;conquer&quot; poverty in the 1600s-1900s? Why hasn't the rest of the world, in particular Asia and Africa, been able to follow their example? Read this book to find out..\n\n\n*******\nA Farewell to Alms asks the right questions, and it is full of fascinating details, like the speed at which information traveled over two millennia (prior to the 19th century, about one mile per hour). Clark's combination of passion and erudition makes his account engaging. When a light bulb goes off in my head, the first thing I ask myself is 'Would this be interest if it were true?' Clark's thesis definitely meets that test.\n(Samuel Bowles Science )\n\nMr. Clark...has produced a well written and thought-provoking thesis, refreshingly light on jargon and equations. It could well be the subject of debate for years to come.\n(The Economist )","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ad64ca7f2d242aabb9d6cb8eab0e1fe52a2afd3","amp;dn":"Gregory+Clark+--+A+Farewell+to+Alms%3A+A+Brief+Economic+History+of","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ad64ca7f2d242aabb9d6cb8eab0e1fe52a2afd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,214,76,167,242,210,66,170,187,157,108,184,234,176,225,254,82,162,175,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
