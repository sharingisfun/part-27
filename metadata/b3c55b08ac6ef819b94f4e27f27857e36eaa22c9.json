The first change came after the sixth song; one of the highlights of the show too, the Coleen-led Ã¢â‚¬ËœEternal FlameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. \n\nHalfway through, each sister had a solo spot, Coleen first, whose Ã¢â‚¬ËœLoose WomenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ colleague Denise Welch was also in attendance. \n\nThen Maureen did a cracking version of Amy WinehouseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœValerieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Linda sand Ã¢â‚¬ËœMercyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ with emotion and Bernie rocked the joint being every inch a rock- chick. \n\nThe girls have certainly improved their stagecraft over the years and they are now seasoned pros; but not so high and mighty as to refuse a young fan a photo. They even invited her onstage to have the picture taken\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ a gesture that went down well with the audience. \n\nThe excellent party night ended with a rousing version of Ã¢â‚¬ËœI Will SurviveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and everyone was on their feet, dancing and singing to Ã¢â‚¬ËœIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m In The Mood For DancingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. \n\nThe show had everything: glitz, glamour, fun, and four gorgeous female singers called Nolan. \n\nWhat more could you ask for?\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/hANmCAAdg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/hANmCAAdg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/leisure/boltonmusic/bandinterviews/4680372.Live_Review__The_Nolans___Manchester_Apollo__13___10___09/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/leisure/boltonmusic/bandinterviews/4680372.Live_Review__The_Nolans___Manchester_Apollo__13___10___09/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1220264/The-Nolans-sex-factor-reunion-tour.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1220264/The-Nolans-sex-factor-reunion-tour.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n \n\n Set List                              Time\n\n 1  - Holding Out For A Hero          06.39  \n 2  - Its Raining Men                 04.13 \n 3  - Chain Reaction                  05.29 \n 4  - Gotta Pull Myself Together       03.53  \n 5  - Attention to Me                 05.07 \n 6  - Eternal Flame                   04.26\n 7  - Girls                          04.47\n 8  - The Promise                     03.47 \n 9  - Ain't No Other Man              04.08 \n 10 - Don't Love Me Too Hard          05.37 \n 11 - The Boy Does Nothing            03.35 \n 12 - Valerie                         04.06 \n 13 - Mercy                           03.24 \n 14 - So What                         03.22 \n 15 - Giving Up Giving In             04.10  \n 16 - Chemistry                       02.48\n 17 - Who's Gonna Rock You            02.04 \n 18 - Crashing Down                   04.09\n 19 - The Voice Within                06.25\n 20 - I Will Survive                  04.47\n 21 - I'm in the Mood for Dancing     07.17\n\n Total Running Time                01.34.24\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3c55b08ac6ef819b94f4e27f27857e36eaa22c9","amp;dn":"The+Nolans+-+Live+-+I%27m+In+The+Mood","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3c55b08ac6ef819b94f4e27f27857e36eaa22c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,197,91,8,172,110,248,25,185,79,78,39,242,120,87,227,110,170,34,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
