These dark, satirical vignettes, clearly inspired by the early issues of 'MAD', were originally drawn for the French humor magazine 'Hara-Kiri', where they appeared from May 1963 to May 1964.\nthe 'Blueberry' stories signed 'Gir', had already begun serialization in 'Pilte' (starting in October '63) when a young Giraud, then 24, felt that he needed a second nom-de-plume to clearly separate his 'serious' production from his more humorous and fantasy-oriented work -- hence the Moebius pseudonym.\nSome of the 'Early Moebius' stories were previously published in three issues of the late, lamented 'French Ticklers' comic-book published by 'Kitchen Sink Press' in 1989.\n'Grand Hotel B, the MYsteries of the Erotic Arts' and the 1974 illustrated 'interview' were done for 'Metal Hurlant' and 'L'Echo des Savanes' in the early '70's- The former two stories appeared in 'heavy Metal', but Moebius prefers the toned version, which is the one we are printing here.\nFinally 'The Gold Digger', which was drawn in 1986, was first published in the summer '87 issue of 'Heavy Meatl'&quot;\n\nA few dupes in this one if you already downloaded my 'Stories from Heavy Metal'  torrent...\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e72472be2c204971808506a9a9d27e4a0da53788","amp;dn":"The+Early+Moebius+%28graphitti+Designs%29+%5BCBR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e72472be2c204971808506a9a9d27e4a0da53788","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,36,114,190,44,32,73,113,128,133,6,169,169,210,126,74,13,165,55,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
