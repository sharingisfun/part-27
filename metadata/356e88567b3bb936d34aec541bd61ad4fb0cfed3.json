Casey Burke Bunn claims to be an ordinary girl who started a business at 25 and wants to share tips so you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t repeat some of her very expensive mistakes. You might disagree with the Ã¢â‚¬Å“ordinaryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ part of that claim. She is a Ã¢â‚¬Å“go-getter.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ And while she is unusual in her determination and ambition, it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be an inspiration to other mere-mortal entrepreneurs who want a peek at how a fearless (naÃƒÂ¯ve?) young entrepreneur with an idea plunged in with both feet and made her dream a reality.\n\n\nNote: All the chapter links and Table of Contents work for both books, using Kindle for Android and PC, and Aldiko for Android and Calibre for PC.\n\n\nEnjoy.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:356e88567b3bb936d34aec541bd61ad4fb0cfed3","amp;dn":"Oh+Crap+I+Need+an+App+ebook++by+Casey++Bunn+epub+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"356e88567b3bb936d34aec541bd61ad4fb0cfed3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,110,136,86,123,59,185,54,211,74,236,84,27,214,26,212,251,12,254,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
