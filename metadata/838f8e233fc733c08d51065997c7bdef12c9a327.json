Small Scale Optics presents the use of optical nonlinear behaviors for spins, antennae, and whispering gallery modes within micro/nano devices and circuits, which can be used in many applications. This book proposes a new design for a small scale optical deviceÃ¢â‚¬â€a microring resonator device. Most chapters are based on the proposed device, which uses a configuration know as a PANDA ring resonator. Analytical and numerical methods demonstrate that many applications can be exploited using this device, in particular when it is coated with metallic material.\n\nThe book begins with the background and description of the PANDA ring resonator. The authors examine optical bistability in microring resonators and test the analytical results with those predicted by the OptiFDTD software package. They then describe their new design for a microring resonator device, which can be used to generate four forms of light on a chip, while also allowing the storing and harvesting of trapped atoms/molecules. The four behaviors of light, for instance, fast, slow, stopping, and storing, can be manipulated and seen simultaneously by using the PANDA ring planar waveguide, which can be fabricated and tested on-chip.\n\nChapters examine optical spin, nano-antennas, optical mesh networks, micro-optical gyroscopes, and spin transport networks. They also address applications for optical devices, including molecular motors for drug discovery, short pulse lasers for treatment of cancer, microsurgery, nano-antenna use in radiotherapy, and neuron cell communications. There are many other possibilities of applications for the PANDA ring resonator, such as quantum coding, optical tweezers, and stopping light, which will play an important role in future optical devices.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:838f8e233fc733c08d51065997c7bdef12c9a327","amp;dn":"Small+Scale+Optics.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"838f8e233fc733c08d51065997c7bdef12c9a327","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,143,142,35,63,199,51,192,141,81,6,89,151,199,189,239,18,201,163,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
