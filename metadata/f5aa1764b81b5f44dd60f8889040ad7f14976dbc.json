Upon arriving at the location, the two Autobots are confronted by Soundwave, but they get a one-of-a-kind opportunity when Soundwave's minion Laserbeak is disabled by the weapons on Wheeljack's ship, the Jackhammer. Ratchet plants a virus in the offline minion while Wheeljack attempts to intercept Soundwave to retrieve the last relic, a sonic resonance based weapon. After an intense fight, Soundwave escapes with the relic, and retrieves Laserbeak. The Virus within Laserbeak is transferred into Soundwave, and through him into the Decepticon computers, and begins downloading the whole Iacon Database to the computer systems in the Autobot headquarters, with the Decepticons unaware of the download as Soundwave begins attempting to decrypt the remainder of the database.  \n\n              ===== File Info ===== \nFileSize           : 175M\nPlayTime           : 00:21:28.121\nVideoCount         : 1\nAudioCount         : 1\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideoCodec         : XVID\nVideoWidth         : 720 piexs\nVideoHeight        : 404 piexs\nVideoFrameRate     : 29.970fps\nVideoFrameCount    : 38605\nVideoBitRate       : 1000257\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudioCodec         : MP3\nAudioBitRate       : 128000\nAudioChannels      : 2\nAudioSampleRate    : 48000\n\n[URL=http://img207.imageshack.us/i/transformersprime214tri.jpg/][IMG]http://img207.imageshack.us/img207/7104/transformersprime214tri.jpg[/IMG][/URL]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5aa1764b81b5f44dd60f8889040ad7f14976dbc","amp;dn":"Transformers+Prime+-+214+-+Triage+%5BOj%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5aa1764b81b5f44dd60f8889040ad7f14976dbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,170,23,100,184,27,95,68,221,96,248,136,144,64,173,127,20,151,109,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
