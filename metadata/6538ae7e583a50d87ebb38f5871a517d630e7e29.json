Active throughout the 1990s and half of the 2000s, The Tea Party released eight albums on EMI Music Canada, selling 1.6 million records worldwide, and achieving a #1 Canadian single &quot;Heaven Coming Down&quot; in 1999.\n\nThe Tea Party toured Canada on twenty-one occasions and Australia on twelve, where they headlined a show in 2002 to an audience of 5,800 at the Hordern Pavilion, Sydney. In November 2002 The Tea Party toured Canada with symphony orchestras reinterpreting a decade&amp;#039;s worth of shared songwriting. Their career together ended abruptly in 2005 due to creative differences.\n\n\nAlbums in this torrent\n\n\nSplendor Solis\n\n\n\nReviews from Wiki:\n\nSplendor Solis (1993) is The Tea Party&amp;#039;s second album, and their first release on EMI Music Canada. The overall tone of the album is very organic and natural, with many songs featuring 6 and 12 string guitar acoustic guitars, and very little in terms of electronic effects or production techniques.\n\nThe album draws heavily on rock and blues of the 1970&amp;#039;s, as well as displaying some psychedelic influences. As a result The Tea Party was often compared to Led Zeppelin, a parallel that was reinforced by Jeff Martin playing guitar with violin bow (not unlike Jimmy Page) on &quot;Save Me&quot;. Martin&amp;#039;s voice and singing style also drew comparisons to that of Jim Morrison, as did some of the album&amp;#039;s lyrics.\n\n&quot;Sure,&quot; said Stuart Chatwood said of these comparisons &quot;we draw from 70s rock as much as the other influences we&amp;#039;ve talked about. You can&amp;#039;t ignore the power that Led Zeppelin or The Doors had, and there are elements of those influences in our songs, but it&amp;#039;s a cop out to then write us off as some retro act. If people listen closely, they&amp;#039;ll appreciate the originality of what we&amp;#039;re doing, time changes. The fact that Jeff&amp;#039;s a rock baritone doesn&amp;#039;t justify the laziness of critics who slag him as a Morrison wanna-be.&quot;[1]\n\nSplendor Solis was very well received in Canada, reaching platinum status in 1994 (now double platinum in 2000) and earning a Juno nomination for &quot;Best Hard Rock Album&quot;. The band was also nominated for &quot;Best New Group&quot;. Splendor Solis was also The Tea Party&amp;#039;s first gold selling album in Australia, where the band had enjoyed great success throughout their career.\n\nTracks\n\n&quot;The River&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 5:44 \n&quot;Midsummer Day&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 5:58 \n&quot;A Certain Slant of Light&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 5:00 \n&quot;Winter Solstice&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 2:45 \n&quot;Save Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 6:35 \n&quot;Sun Going down&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 6:31 \n&quot;In This Time&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:57 \n&quot;Dreams of Reason&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 6:19 \n&quot;Raven Skies&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 5:17 \n&quot;Haze on the Hills&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 2:24 \n&quot;The Majestic Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:37 \n\n\n\n\nThe Edges of Twilight\n\n\n\nThe Edges of Twilight (1995) is the third album by The Tea Party. The album features many instruments from around the world, giving various songs a strong world music flavour in addition to the rock/blues influences evident in the band&amp;#039;s earlier releases. Jeff Burrows explained that &quot;basically we wanted to expand upon the initial idea that we tried on Splendor Solis, which was trying to incorporate different styles of world music into our music. So with this album we became more familiar with many more instruments. In our minds we were trying to do for a rock album what Peter Gabriel does to pop by infusing various cultures, percussion and exotic sounds into it.&quot;[1]\n\nThe Edges of Twilight helped propel the band into mainstream success in their native Canada, where it reached double platinum status and earned the band several Juno nominations, including &quot;Best Rock Album&quot; and &quot;Group of the Year&quot;.\n\nThe title of the album is taken from a chapter of the book Fire in the Head, by American author Tom Cowan, which also inspired the name of the first track on the album.\n\nThe album also includes a hidden song which features a spoken word performance by folk legend Roy Harper, who is a friend of the band.\n\nFeatured on the cover is a statue by William Wetmore Story called Angel of Grief.\n\n\nTracks\n\n&quot;Fire in the Head&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 5:06 \n&quot;The Bazaar&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:42 \n&quot;Correspondences&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 7:28 \n&quot;The Badger&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:58 \n&quot;Silence&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 2:51 \n&quot;Sister Awake&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 5:43 \n&quot;Turn the Lamp down Low&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 5:16 \n&quot;Shadows on the Mountainside&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:39 \n&quot;Drawing down the Moon&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 5:26 \n&quot;Inanna&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:48 &quot;Coming Home&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 5:53 \n&quot;Walk with Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 14:20 (includes a spoken word piece by Roy Harper) \n\n\n\n\nAlhambra\n\n\n\n\nAlhambra (1996) is an EP by The Tea Party and was used as a bridge between The Edges of Twilight and Transmission. It features four intricately re-worked acoustic songs from The Edges of Twilight and two others; the first a song entitled &quot;Time&quot; with Roy Harper on vocals, the second a remix of Sister Awake by Rhys Fulber.\n\nAlhambra is an Enhanced CD and includes multimedia that the band used as a way to explain themselves, inviting fans to explore the details of exotic instruments, song meanings and video &amp; audio clips.\n\nThe first song on the EP is &quot;The Grand Bazaar&quot;, which was recorded during The Edges of Twilight sessions in December 1994 at A&amp;M Studios (Los Angeles). The acoustic songs and &quot;Time&quot; were recorded in August 1995 at Studio Morin Heights (Morin Heights), with more acoustic versions of songs from these sessions appearing as B-sides (&quot;The River&quot;, &quot;Save Me&quot; and &quot;Sister Awake&quot;) on later singles and the European Triptych Special Tour Edition 2000 album.\n\nEMI Music Canada re-issued Alhambra on 5 March 2002 with the multimedia CD-ROM component updated to work correctly on the Windows XP Operating System. The EP was also long out of stock in Canada.\n\nTracks\n\n&quot;The Grand Bazaar&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:55 \n&quot;Inanna (acoustic version)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:20 \n&quot;Silence (acoustic version)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:57 \n&quot;Turn the Lamp Down (acoustic version)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:58 \n&quot;Time&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 6:58 \n&quot;Sister Awake Remix&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:37 \n\n\n\n\nTransmission\n\n\n\nTransmission is the fourth album recorded by Canadian band The Tea Party, released in 1997 (see 1997 in music). The album sees the band expanding on the mix of rock, blues, and world music found in their previous albums by adding electronic instruments and recording techniques to their repertoire.\n\nWhile still using several exotic instruments and maintaining the &quot;eastern&quot; influence in the recording, many songs also include samples, sequencers, and loops alongside the traditional acoustic instruments. The result is a harder, industrial sound, owing more to Nine Inch Nails than Led Zeppelin. The album is the angriest and most despairing release by the band, with lyrical references to the afterlife (&quot;Psychopomp&quot;), dystopian works of Aldous Huxley, George Orwell, Yevgeny Zamyatin (&quot;Army Ants&quot;) and Giovanni Piranesi&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;Imaginary Prisons&amp;#039; (&quot;Alarum&quot;).\n\nTransmission continued to build on the momentum generated by The Edges of Twilight, reaching double platinum status in Canada and receiving a 1998 Juno nomination for &quot;Blockbuster Rock Album of the Year&quot;.\n\nTracks:\n\n&quot;Temptation&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:25 \n&quot;Army Ants&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:33 \n&quot;Psychopomp&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 5:17 \n&quot;Gyroscope&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 2:56 \n&quot;Alarum&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:58 \n&quot;Release&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:05 \n&quot;Transmission&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 5:17 \n&quot;Babylon&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 2:50 \n&quot;Pulse&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:09 \n&quot;Emerald&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:51 \n&quot;Aftermath&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 5:43 \n\n\n\n\nTriptych\n\n\n\nTriptych (1999) is The Tea Party&amp;#039;s fifth album, and saw the trio blending the major influences found on their previous albums: the earthy rock of Splendor Solis, the world music inspired arrangements of The Edges of Twilight, and the industrial edge of Transmission.\n\nTriptych displayed a band with a new confidence in songwriting. After the gloom of Transmission, which relied heavily on sampling and electronica, Triptych saw a band writing with both melody and content, whilst using electronica subtlety.[1] Evidenced by the Juno Award nominated single &quot;Heaven Coming down&quot;, the band&amp;#039;s first number one single in Canada. Triptych received a Juno nomination for &quot;Best Rock Album&quot;, before achieving double platinum sales in Canada.\n\nTracks\n\n&quot;Touch&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:57 \n&quot;Underground&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:41 \n&quot;Great Big Lie&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:50 \n&quot;Heaven Coming Down&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:01 \n&quot;The Halcyon Days&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 5:57 \n&quot;The Messenger&quot; (Daniel Lanois cover) ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:32 \n&quot;Samsara &quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:56 \n&quot;A Slight Attack&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:15 \n&quot;Taking Me Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 5:02 \n&quot;These Living Arms&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 5:03 \n&quot;Chimera&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:29 \n&quot;Gone&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:35 \nUntitled ÃƒÂ¢?? 1:02 \n\n\n\n\nThe Interzone Mantras\n\n\n\nThe Interzone Mantras (2001) is the sixth album from Canadian rock group The Tea Party.\nNamed after William S. Burroughs&amp;#039; book of short stories Interzone and the band&amp;#039;s interest in eastern mysticism and esoteric philosophies[1], the songwriting on The Interzone Mantras builds on the subtle electronica and ballads of Triptych, whilst returning to the familiar territory of their earlier albums with 70&amp;#039;s rock and world music influences.[2] Jeff Martin explained that the album was a return to basics:\n\n&quot;The last two records, Transmission and Triptych, were very much creations of the studio - meticulously built. With this record we felt that we wanted to put a spark of passion underneath our asses.\n&quot;So many people have told us that we&amp;#039;re this great live rock band, and I just wanted to see if, as producer, I could capture that on this record. I put us in a rehearsal space, the three of us, faced each other with just guitar, bass and drums - no toys - and, you know, &amp;#039;let&amp;#039;s Rock!&amp;#039;&quot; The new approach fired the band up to such an extent that the album was recorded in just twenty days - &quot;unheard of&quot; for The Tea Party, Martin says.\nMartin has special praise for drummer Jeff Burrows, who he proudly proclaims to be &quot;THE best rock drummer going&quot;, and who did every drum track in one take.[1]\n\nLyrically the album draws from the works of modern writers Aleister Crowley, Mikhail Bulgakov, Wim Wenders, to ancient Greek mythology (Morpheus on &quot;Lullaby&quot;). The lyrics themselves written by Martin when holidaying in Prague, after the music was written from jams in the band&amp;#039;s rehearsal space.[3]\n\nThe first 100,000 Canadian copies of The Interzone Mantras were packaged with a special lenticular cover, with Alessandro Bavari&amp;#039;s depiction of Shiva moving depending on the viewing angle. Although not as commercially successful as previous albums, The Interzone Mantras is The Tea Party&amp;#039;s highest charting album in Australia (debuting at #6 on the ARIA chart) and is certified Gold in Canada. It was also nominated for &quot;Rock Album of the Year&quot; at the 2003 Juno Awards.\n\nTracks\n\n&quot;Interzone&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:39 \n&quot;Angels&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:54 \n&quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:13 \n&quot;Apathy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:55 \n&quot;Soulbreaking&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:45 \n&quot;Lullaby&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:19 \n&quot;Must Must&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:59 \n&quot;White Water Siren&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:54 \n&quot;Cathartik&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 5:00 \n&quot;Dust to Gold&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:20 \n&quot;Requiem&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:30 \n&quot;Mantra&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 8:00 \n\n\n\n\nSeven Circles\n\n\n\nSeven Circles (2004) is The Tea Party&amp;#039;s seventh album, and the last prior to the band breaking up in 2005. The album continues the style of the band&amp;#039;s two previous offerings (The Interzone Mantras in 2001 and Triptych in 1999) by combining world music influences with rock instrumentation and electronic studio techniques. The album is also one of the band&amp;#039;s most positive sounding records, forsaking the dystopian imagery and moody lyrics of past albums, and including several ballads that border on love-song territory. This change in focus has led to both praise and criticism from fans.[citation needed]\n\nThe album is dedicated to the memory of Steve Hoffman, the late manager of The Tea Party, who died of lung cancer in October 2003. Track 4, &quot;Oceans&quot; was written in his honour, with a promotional single released in May 2005 The Tea Party hoped to bring more attention to the Steven Hoffman Fund.[1]\n\nSeven Circles marks the first time that Jeff Martin has duetted with another artist; &quot;Wishing you would Stay&quot; features fellow Canadian vocalist Holly McNarland, as a counterpoint to Martin&amp;#039;s baritone.\n\nThe album peaked at number 5 on Billboard&amp;#039;s Top Canadian Album chart, reaching gold status in Canada. Seven Circles also received a nomination for &quot;Rock Album of the Year&quot; at the 2005 Juno Awards.\n\nTracks\n\n&quot;Writing&amp;#039;s on the Wall&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 2:40 \n&quot;Stargazer&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:11 \n&quot;One Step Closer Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:49 \n&quot;Oceans&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:35 \n&quot;Luxuria&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:25 \n&quot;Overload&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:53 \n&quot;Coming Back Again&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:44 \n&quot;The Watcher&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:16 \n&quot;Empty Glass&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:16 \n&quot;Wishing You Would Stay&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:11 \n&quot;Seven Circles&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 7:36 \n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6538ae7e583a50d87ebb38f5871a517d630e7e29","amp;dn":"The+Tea+Party+-+Discography+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6538ae7e583a50d87ebb38f5871a517d630e7e29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,56,174,126,88,58,80,216,126,187,56,245,135,26,81,125,99,14,126,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
