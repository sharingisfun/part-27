But now bestselling         :\n : historian Gavin Menzies makes the startling argument that in the year 1434,:\n : ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â€then the world's most technologically advanced civilizationÃ¢â‚¬â€provided :\n : the spark that set the European Renaissance ablaze. From that date onward, :\n : Europeans embraced Chinese intellectual ideas, discoveries, and inventions,:\n : all of which form the basis of western civilization today.                 :\n :                                                                            :\n : Florence and Venice of the early fifteenth century were hubs of world      :\n : trade, attracting traders from across the globe.

He brings the reader    :\n : aboard the remarkable Chinese fleet as it sails from China to Cairo and    :\n : Florence, and then back across the world.
