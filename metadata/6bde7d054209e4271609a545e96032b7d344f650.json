Camel also distinguish themselves from their prog rock peers with the multi-part suite &quot;Lady Fantasy,&quot; which suggests the more complex directions they would take a few albums down the line. Also, Latimer's graceful flute playing distinguishes several songs on the record, including &quot;Supertwister,&quot; and it's clear that he has a more supple technique than such contemporaries as Ian Anderson. Camel are still ironing out some quirks in their sound on Mirage, but it's evident that they are coming into their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01.
