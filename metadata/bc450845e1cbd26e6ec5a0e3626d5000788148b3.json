Imprisoned for violent assault, he's a cocky, good-looking young man placed in the hardcore ward, where his survival depends on quickly learning the prison's parallel world of rules, honor, and obligations. R also stands for Rachid, a young Muslim prisoner who becomes Rune's friend and accomplice, defying the rigid racial stratifications among the inmates.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1434443/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1434443/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc450845e1cbd26e6ec5a0e3626d5000788148b3","amp;dn":"R-2010+Danish+Screener+Engsub+avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc450845e1cbd26e6ec5a0e3626d5000788148b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,69,8,69,225,203,210,110,110,197,160,227,98,109,80,0,120,129,72,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
