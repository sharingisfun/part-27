The song was originally released as a double A-side with &quot;Great DJ&quot; by independent record label Switchflicker on May 28, 2007. After heavy promotion and support from BBC Radio 1 and the NME, the single was re-released individually on May 12, 2008 on Columbia Records.\n\n&quot;That's Not My Name&quot; went to number one in the UK Singles Chart on May 18, 2008, seeing off competition from well-established acts like Rihanna, Madonna and will.i.am. The following week, however, the single was replaced by Rihanna's single &quot;Take a Bow&quot; at number one.\n\nThe music video features the Ting Tings in a park, where some people costumed by skeletons start to show themselves, with some words of the lyrics of That's Not My Name.\n\nThe single received favourable reviews from critics upon re-release, with the NME describing it as &quot;no-flab electro-pop nugget&quot;, while Q Magazine described it as &quot;a snatch of Hey Mickey-style handclaps and a gobbily staccato vocal, stitched together to fashion a groove thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s as instant and familiar&quot;. Digital Spy compared the single to a &quot;well-shaken can of cola&quot;, and added &quot;[the track is] brimming with sticky, yummy, fizzy goodness&quot;.\n\nIn the United States, the song is growing in popularity. The song has been released to the US iTunes Store, and it has so far peaked at #26 on the US Top 100 Songs. It has also peaked at #64 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b3b22472ca5b5f8247fcedcc122708895d88c1c","amp;dn":"The+Ting+Tings+-+That%5C%27s+Not+My+Name","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b3b22472ca5b5f8247fcedcc122708895d88c1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,59,34,71,44,165,181,248,36,127,206,220,193,34,112,136,149,216,140,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
