The Complete Motown Masters [2012]\n\nmp3 v0\n\nÃ¢Ë†â€™ Original Release / Kent Records UK / CDTOP 369 / CD\n\nFrederick 'Shorty' Long has always had a special place in the affections of all serious Motown collectors, although he recorded less than three dozen tracks in total in his five years with the company. His singles on Motown's Soul label are cherished artifacts of the company's Golden Era and have been for decades now.\nUnfortunately Shorty died in a boating accident in 1969, just as he was beginning to move into the commercial mainstream. and shortly before his second album was due to be released. His catalogue has not been too well served in the CD era, but Kent aims to rectify that with the latest release in our ongoing series of Motown projects.\n\nHere Comes...Shorty Long presents all the masters that were mixed to stereo by Motown's engineers in the 60s, and includes the world premiere of a very different take of his great version of the Big Bopper's Chantilly Lace, as well as many of his eternally popular hits such as Function At the Junction, Devil In The Blue Dress and Here Come The Judge.\n\nWith typically copious illustrations and an annotation that includes a personal memoir of Shorty by his frequent Motown collaborator Sylvia Moy, this is a package that every vintage Motown fan will want.\n\n\n1.
