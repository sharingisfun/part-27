Active since 1995, he has recorded a total of ten studio albums, including several independent works, three for Republic Records and one for BNA. Twelve of his singles have charted on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, of which the highest-peaking is the #3 &quot;Wave on Wave&quot; from his gold-certified album of the same name.\nPatrick Craven Green was born in San Antonio and was raised in Waco, Texas. His parents, Craven Earl Green and Patricia Burgess, divorced when he was seven. His father, a former Air Force officer, was also a stage actor, which influenced Pat's love for music. When his mother remarried to a man with 5 daughters, Pat suddenly became one of nine children. Green attended grades 7-12 at Vanguard College Preparatory School in Waco, Texas. \nGreen attended school at Texas Tech and was a member of FarmHouse Fraternity. While a student at Tech, 18-year-old Pat started his music career by playing small gigs at bars and clubs around Lubbock. In 1995, with money borrowed from his parents, Green independently recorded and released a series of albums, produced by Lloyd Maines. He did not make a full commitment to his music career until 1997, when his stepfather fired him from his job as a fuel wholesaler. His stepfather saw Green counting the money he had made singing over the weekend and knew that Green needed a push to fully pursue his dream. \nSoon Green caught the ear of Willie Nelson and began touring with him and other famous country musicians. His appearance at the 1998 Willie Nelson 4th of July Picnic marked the start of his road to nationwide recognition. He was soon playing sold out shows in Texas (including at the Houston Astrodome). Green was sponsored by Miller Lite, and sold more than 250,000 albumsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½all without signing a major-label recording contract. \nGreen's first major-label recorded album, Three Days was released in 2001 and he has since released three more albums. The hugely successful &quot;Wave on Wave&quot; was released and brought with it a number 3 hit for the single of the same name. In late 2004 &quot;Lucky Ones&quot; was Green's 3rd and final CD release on the Universal/Republic label. After spending many years playing to young audiences in &quot;college towns&quot; across America, Green joined popular country music artists like Keith Urban, Gretchen Wilson, Kenny Chesney, and others on major headliner tours. Grammy Award]]s. \nGreen released his album Cannonball in 2006. The same year, he toured with labelmate Kenny Chesney. \nGreen released his first book &quot;Pat Green's Dance Halls &amp; Dreamers&quot;. in February 2008. The coffee table-style book contains more than 200 photographs of 10 dance halls Green has frequented throughout his career such as Gruene Hall, Luckenbach, Floore's Country Store and Schroeder Hall, as well as behind-the-scenes interviews with Texas music artists like Willie Nelson, Jack Ingram, Cross Canadian Ragweed, and Robert Earl Keen.\nGreen once known as the pinnacle of &quot;Texas Country&quot; music with songs like &quot;I Like Texas&quot; and &quot;Southbound 35&quot; has taken a significant turn since the release of his major label albums and big act tours. Now striving for pop country stardom, Green continues to climb the Nashville charts and build a national fan base as he smooths out his sound through contemporary country releases.\nIn 2008, Green released the single &quot;Let Me&quot;, the first single for his latest album What I'm For.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb55d28c5355d064ac0621acf2bf4972c4e3e0f6","amp;dn":"Pat+Green-8+albums-country","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb55d28c5355d064ac0621acf2bf4972c4e3e0f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,85,210,140,83,85,208,100,172,6,33,172,242,191,73,114,196,227,224,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
