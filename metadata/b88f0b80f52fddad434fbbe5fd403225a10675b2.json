Box of Visions\n\n-For his sixth release, Russell hired West Coast roots rock producer/bassist Dusty Wakeman for a big sound that at times recalls Bruce Springsteen's Darkness On the Edge of Town. . . . Russell is a gifted songwriter who populates his songs with empathetic characters and adds details that evoke the smell of blood or choking power of dust. Manzanar&quot; adopts the point of view of a former Japanese-American prisoner put in an American concentration camp built after Pearl Harbor was bombed; &quot;Hong Kong Boy&quot; depicts the violence and racism of Chinese gangs vs. the Vietnamese . . . and the pumped-up, blue-eyed soul of &quot;The Extra Mile&quot; pays tribute to durable singer Mitch Ryder.\n\n-On &quot;box of visions,&quot; songwriter Tom Russell takes his trademark characters Ã¢â‚¬â€œ burned-out gamblers, madmen, death-wish women, drunks and holloweyed dreamers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and portrays them as visionaries. Russell's protagonists are continually haunted by apparitions from the past, obsessed with what might have been as the present slips away.\n\nBox opens with &quot;Angel of Lyon,&quot; the story of a rich man who pursues his vision of love to the point of poverty, dissolution and madness; he never attains it Ã¢â‚¬â€œ his &quot;angel&quot; is a woman who has joined a convent. Box contains some of Russell's finest moments as a lyricist Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;Heart of Hearts&quot;; &quot;Purgatory Road,&quot; a lament written with Tom Pacheco; &quot;Manzanar,&quot; about the World War II internment camps for Japanese-Americans; &quot;Blood Oranges,&quot; a mystical fable written for Paul Bowles; and &quot;The Extra Mile,&quot; an R&amp;B-style tribute to Mitch Ryder.\n\nRussell forgoes his regular band in favor of such guest musicians as David Hidalgo, Katy Moffatt, David Mansfield, Dusty Wakeman and others; only lead guitarist Andrew Hardin remains. As a result, the arrangements are stiffer and less evocative than on previous records (the absence of multi-instrumentalist Fats Kaplin is especially noticeable). Still, most of the time it works, and even when it doesn't, Russell's words and voice carry him through","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b88f0b80f52fddad434fbbe5fd403225a10675b2","amp;dn":"Tom+Russell+-+Box+Of+Visions+%5B1993%5D+%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b88f0b80f52fddad434fbbe5fd403225a10675b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,143,11,128,245,47,221,173,67,79,187,229,253,64,50,37,161,6,117,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
