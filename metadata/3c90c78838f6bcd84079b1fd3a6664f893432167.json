Late in World War Two, the underpowered PBM-3 was upgraded with better engines to become the PBM-5, but it was clear that a better design was needed for the post-war era. The Mariner's successor first flew as the XP5M-1 prototype in May 1948 and went into full production as the P5M-1 in 1953. Delivery of the T-tail P5M-2 started in April 1954. The -2 also had a reconfigured bow and more powerful engines. Production of the P5M-2 (later designated SP-5B) ended in late 1960 with 103 going to the Navy, 4 to the USCG and 10 to the French Navy. The Marlin excelled in the all-weather ASW role and stayed in service until 6 November, 1967.\n\n\nFeatures :\n\n- very high quality native FSX interior (cockpit) and exterior models.\n\n- Six finely-detailed 2048-pixel liveries:\n\n135516, VP-40, USN, c.1956\n5502, VP-40, USN, c.1962\n7931, VP-3, USN, c.1962\n5542, VP-48, USN, c.1957\n1318, USCG, c.1960\n'5', 27.F, AÃƒÂ©ronavale, c.1959\n\n- accurate virtual cockpit with authentic gauges, controls and custom animations.\n- animated hydro flaps, crew doors/hatches, nacelle doors and crew figures.\n- togglable beaching gear.\n- water spray effect on take-off.\n- custom engine start-up smoke effect.\n- togglable realistic crew figures with period flight gear.\n- animated, featherable propeller blades.\n- illustrated user manual in PDF format.\n- period radial engine sound set.\n- PhotoShop paint kit files provided.\n- Note - NO 2D panel is provided. \n\nShit talkers can go fuck themselves, but you REAL pirates enjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c90c78838f6bcd84079b1fd3a6664f893432167","amp;dn":"FSX+-+Virtavia+SP-5B+Marlin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c90c78838f6bcd84079b1fd3a6664f893432167","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,144,199,136,56,246,188,216,64,121,177,253,58,102,100,248,147,67,33,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
