He demonstrates that high levels of cooperation are found where people have to band together to fight off a common enemy, and that this kind of cooperation led to the formation of the Roman and Russian empires, and the United States. But as empires grow, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, conflict replaces cooperation, and dissolution inevitably follows. Eloquently argued and rich with historical examples, War and Peace and War offers a bold new theory about the course of world history.\n\n\n# Paperback: 416 pages\n# Publisher: Plume (February 27, 2007)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0452288193\n# ISBN-13: 978-0452288195","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc52de547a4769534bea4b5722e52707b2bf9369","amp;dn":"War+and+Peace+and+War%3AThe+Rise+and+Fall+of+Empires%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc52de547a4769534bea4b5722e52707b2bf9369","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,82,222,84,122,71,105,83,75,234,75,87,34,229,39,7,178,191,147,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
