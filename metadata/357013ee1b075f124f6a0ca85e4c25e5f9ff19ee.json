Proving himself as an accomplished cannoneer in battle, however, Bask earns the respect, and even admiration of the Emir and his crew.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:357013ee1b075f124f6a0ca85e4c25e5f9ff19ee","amp;dn":"Moving+Fortress","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"357013ee1b075f124f6a0ca85e4c25e5f9ff19ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,112,19,238,27,7,95,18,79,106,12,168,94,76,37,229,249,255,25,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
