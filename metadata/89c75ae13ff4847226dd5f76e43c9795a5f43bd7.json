This is one of my favorite versions of Gunfight at the OK Corral.\n\nWide screen, color, english only, no subs, avi format.  Excellent quality.\n\nMarshal Wyatt Earp kills a couple of men of the Clanton-gang in a fight. In revenge Clanton&amp;#039;s thugs kill the marshal&amp;#039;s brother. Thus, Wyatt Earp starts to chase the killers together with his friend Doc Holliday. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89c75ae13ff4847226dd5f76e43c9795a5f43bd7","amp;dn":"John+Sturges+-+Hour+Of+The+Gun+1967+ENG.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89c75ae13ff4847226dd5f76e43c9795a5f43bd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,199,90,225,63,244,132,114,38,221,95,118,228,60,151,149,165,244,59,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
