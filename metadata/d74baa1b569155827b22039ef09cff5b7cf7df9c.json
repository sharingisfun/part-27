It describes basic      \n   theoretical considerations of nanoplasmons in the dielectric              \n   environment, gives examples of the multitude of applications of           \n   nanoplasmonics in biomedical and chemical sensing, and provides an        \n   overview of future trends in optical and non-optical nanoplasmonic        \n   sensing. Specifically, readers are guided through both the fundamentals   \n   and the latest research in the two major fields nanoplasmonic sensing     \n   is applied to  bio- and chemo-sensing  then given the state-of-the-art    \n   recipes used in nanoplasmonic sensing research.                           \n\n  +-[ ALEXANDRIA ]----------------------------------------------------------+\n  : The Royal Library of Alexandria, or Ancient Library of Alexandria, in   :\n  : Alexandria, Egypt, was the largest and most significant great library   :\n  : of the ancient world.
