Always put his life on the line for someone else, managing to survive by pure luck and skill. After bringing an end to a multi-state drug ring, he was finally able to live the life he had wanted as a Last RiderÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n\nA good man would walk away and not touch the curvy woman who had been tugging on his heartstrings. Lucky wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a good man. Therefore, the bad-ass biker in him had a choice: once again become the man he had pretended to be and stake his claim, or take the devilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s highway. \n\n\nSome girls had all the luck. \n\nWilla wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t one of them. All she wanted to do was give a home to the children she had made orphans. Instead, she found herself needing help from the man who had left the pulpit behind to embrace a life of sin. \n\nPainfully shy and withdrawn she wanted a quiet life, a simple man, and well-behaved children. The last thing she had ever expected was for Lucky to want her size twenty body and show her a passion that would lead her straight to hell. \n\n*WARNING* \nThis work of fiction is intended for mature audiences only.
