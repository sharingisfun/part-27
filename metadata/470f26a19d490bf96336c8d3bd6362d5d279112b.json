The book opens by analyzing the logic of backward design as an alternative to coverage and activity-oriented plans.  Though backward from habit, this approach brings more focus and coherence to instruction.  The book proposes a multifaceted approach, with the six Ã¢â‚¬Å“facetsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of understanding.  The facets combine with backward design to provide a powerful, expanded array of practical tools and strategies for designing curriculum, instruction, and assessments that lead students at all grade levels to genuine understanding.  \n\nThe second edition, a refined work, has been thoroughly and extensively revised, updated, and expanded, including improvement of the UbD Template, the key terms of UbD, dozens of worksheets, and some of the larger concepts. The authors have successfully put together a text that demonstrates what best practice in the design of learning looks like, enhancing for its audience their capability for creating more engaging and effective learning, whether the student is a third grader, a college freshman, or a faculty member.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:470f26a19d490bf96336c8d3bd6362d5d279112b","amp;dn":"Understanding+by+Design%2C+Expanded+2nd+Edition+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"470f26a19d490bf96336c8d3bd6362d5d279112b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,15,38,161,157,73,11,249,99,54,200,211,189,99,98,213,210,121,17,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
