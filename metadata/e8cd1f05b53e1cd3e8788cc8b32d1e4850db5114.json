Heavies like Spooner Oldham; keys, Dan Penn; vocals, Johnny Sandlin; drums, Donnie Fritts; Hammond B-3, and many more, weighed-in to finish the tracks after Hinton died in '95; it may be one explanation for the absolutely contemporary and immediate feeling to the recording. &quot;Lovin' Chain&quot; swings with the familiarity of an Atlantic Records soul-era classic; &quot;Three Pounds of Hongry&quot; is a back porch country blues; &quot;I Got My Thang Together&quot; is good ol' Southern Rock; &quot;Here I Am&quot; with its doo wop melody and brand of sexual bravado is a simple plea for love. The set's heartbreaker is its title track. Like that weird note Otis Redding reaches for in &quot;I've Been Lovin' You Too Long,&quot; Hinton hits one in &quot;Hard Luck Guy.&quot; It's difficult not to be struck by his aching sound and the song's sentiment given the singer's fate.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8cd1f05b53e1cd3e8788cc8b32d1e4850db5114","amp;dn":"Eddie+Hinton+-+Hard+Luck+Guy+%281999%29+MP3%40320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8cd1f05b53e1cd3e8788cc8b32d1e4850db5114","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,205,31,5,181,62,28,211,232,120,140,200,179,45,30,72,80,219,81,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
