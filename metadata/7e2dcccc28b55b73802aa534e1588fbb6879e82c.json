But that doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t matter. On their debut album, The Sign, they managed to create a piece of melodic Euro-disco that was a huge hit all over the world, appealing to both dance clubs and pop radio. And with singles like \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;All That She Wants,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;The Sign,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t Turn Around,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s easy to see why they were hits -- the beat is relentless and the hooks are incessantly catchy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e2dcccc28b55b73802aa534e1588fbb6879e82c","amp;dn":"Ace+of+Base+-+The+Sign","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e2dcccc28b55b73802aa534e1588fbb6879e82c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,45,204,204,40,181,91,115,128,42,165,52,225,88,143,187,104,121,232,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
