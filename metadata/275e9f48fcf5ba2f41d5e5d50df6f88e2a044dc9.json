Highlights include acid-tinged and very psychedelic Ã¢â‚¬ËœProdigal SonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, dreamy arrangements of HandelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœLargoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, powerful rendition of The BeatlesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬ËœYesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and two Graham Bond songs (who also wrote the sleeve notes): Ã¢â‚¬ËœLove ls The LawÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœCrossroads Of TimeÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ. This is one of the best UK psychedelic albums ever!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:275e9f48fcf5ba2f41d5e5d50df6f88e2a044dc9","amp;dn":"Eyes+of+Blue+-+Crossroads+Of+Time+%281968%2F2012%29+%5BFLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"275e9f48fcf5ba2f41d5e5d50df6f88e2a044dc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,94,159,72,252,245,186,47,65,213,229,213,13,246,248,142,42,4,77,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
