There are sets of rules included into PVS-Studio:\n\nThe PVS-Studio tool is intended for developers of contemporary applications and it integrates into the Visual Studio 2012, 2010, 2008, 2005 environment providing the programmer with a convenient user interface to analyze files, navigate through code and get reference information. You do not need to study documentation and settings preliminarily to work with the analyzer. The analyzer is ready to work right after it is installed.\n\nThe methodology of static code analysis we employ has significant advantages over other types of analysis since it allows you to cover the whole program code. The procedure of code check cannot damage the code itself in any way. The analysis process is completely controlled by person and it is the programmer who decides if it needs modification.\n\nPVS-Studio Features\n\nIntegration with Visual Studio 2012, 2010, 2008, 2005;\nonline-help;\npdf-documentation;\nsaving and loading of analysis results;\ncapability of command line launch;\nsupport of all cores and processors;\nestimate of complexity of 64-bit code migration;\nsupport of Windows (LLP64) and Linux (LP64) data models;\ninteractive filters;\nconvenient integration into the team development process;\nmarking of program text with the purpose of checking new code only.\n\nHomepage: http://www.viva64.com/en/pvs-studio/\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n1.
