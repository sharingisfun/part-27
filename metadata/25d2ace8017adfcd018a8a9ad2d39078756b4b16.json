This text is an introductory 2-semester college level book with mostly inorganic chemistry but some organic, materials chemistry and biochemistry as well.\n\nFor your convenience each chapter has its own .pdf file. These files are not scanned into a pdf! They are of very high quality taken directly from the mastering chemistry (dot) com.\n\nI ask a few things of all of you. First, whoever grabs this file please seed one-to-one ratio and spread this textbook around. Second, this is free and on the Barnes and Noble website the text is listed at $140. Please spare 5,10,20 dollars and give a donation to your local elementary school. Knowledge is a wonderful thing and should be free to all, especially our young people.\n\nOh yeah, one more thing....Shame on all the textbook publishers out there. This &quot;new&quot; text is pretty much exactly like the 10th edition. Stop taking advantage of your monopolistic position and start treating students with a bit of respect.\n\nSee Ya!\n\nISBN is: 9780136006176\nPublisher: Prentice Hall\nPub.
