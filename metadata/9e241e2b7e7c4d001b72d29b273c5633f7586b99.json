Formed by songwriter Dave Jackson and bassist Becky Stringer in 1979, The Room reaped critical acclaim with singles such as In Sickness And In Health and Things Have Learnt To Walk That Ought To Crawl, as well as the album Indoor Fireworks (1982) and several John Peel BBC sessions. In 1983-84 the band had a shot a chart success on a major label, with the excellent album In Evil Hour produced by John Porter (Smiths) and mercurial Television personality Tom Verlaine. In 1988 the core of the band morphed into Benny Profane, and later still became Dead Cowboys.\nNo Dream is an unashamed Best Of compilation spanning the band's entire career, comprising singles, choice album cuts and unreleased demo tracks from their final studio session. From the monochrome post-punk of debut single Motion to the rich textures of In Evil Hour, even the most cursory listen reveals The Room as one of the most criminally underrated bands of their time.  \n\n\ntracklist\n\n01 Motion\n02 In Sickeness And In Health\n03 Bated Breath\n04 Things Have Learnt To Walk That Ought To Crawl\n05 No Dream\n06 Hate Haze\n07 100 Years\n08 Never (demo)\n09 The Ride\n10 A Shirt Of Fire\n11 Whirlpool\n12 Jackpot Jack\n13 Crying Red\n14 Calloused Hands\n15 Here Comes The Floor (demo)\n16 The Storm (demo)\n17 Untitled (demo)\n18 Jeremiah (demo) \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e241e2b7e7c4d001b72d29b273c5633f7586b99","amp;dn":"The+Room+-+No+Dream+%5B1980+-+1986%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e241e2b7e7c4d001b72d29b273c5633f7586b99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,36,30,43,126,124,77,0,27,114,210,155,39,60,86,51,247,88,107,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
