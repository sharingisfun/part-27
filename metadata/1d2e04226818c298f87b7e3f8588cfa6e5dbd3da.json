This first free issue launches a new ongoing series of Top Cow's fan favorite, memory challenged, green haired, questionably human heroine. Hundreds of years after a cataclysmic event scorched the surface, Earth and its inhabitants have been forever altered and a new landscape and political struggle has taken hold with three distinct factions fighting for control. Aphrodite IX is both anachronism and advanced technology in a world that she no longer recognizes. No aliens, just humans and their genetically and technologically altered descendants in a mixture of the best Sci-Fi and Fantasy has to offer!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d2e04226818c298f87b7e3f8588cfa6e5dbd3da","amp;dn":"APHRODITE+IX+001+%28ic+Book+Day+2013%29+%28Digital%29+%28Darkness-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d2e04226818c298f87b7e3f8588cfa6e5dbd3da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,46,4,34,104,24,194,152,248,123,126,63,133,136,207,166,229,219,211,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
