Whatever his past, he's obviously skilled as a gunslinger, and soon finds himself drawn into a conflict between homesteader Joe Starrett (Van Heflin) and ruthless cattle baron Rufus Ryker (Emile Meyer), who wants to force Starrett and the others off the land. Shane stays for supper and the night at the invitation of Joe's wife, Marian (Jean Arthur), and starts working as a farmhand.\n\nShane goes into town with Starrett and the rest of the homesteaders to pick up supplies at a general store. Adjacent to the store, but separated from it by an inside door, is a bar. \n\nShane enters the bar, where Ryker's men are, and orders soda pop. Chris Calloway (Ben Johnson), one of Ryker's men, taunts Shane and throws whiskey on him, saying &quot;..smell like a man!&quot; but Shane backs down. On a later occasion, Calloway bullies Shane again. This time, Shane orders two shots of whiskey. He pours one on Calloway's shirt and throws the other in his face followed by a punch that knocks Calloway back into the general store. A bar room brawl ensues as Ryker's men gang up on Shane. However, Starrett enters the bar and with his help, Shane wins the fight, but the shopkeeper orders them out. Ryker declares that the next time Shane or Joe go to town the &quot;air will be filled with gunsmoke.&quot;\n\nYoung Joey (Brandon deWilde) is drawn to him and the gun, and wants Shane to teach him how to shoot. Shane shows him how to wear his holster and demonstrates his speed and aim on a target Joey picks out. His mother interrupts them, saying guns aren't going to be part of her boy's life. Shane explains a gun is a tool, no better no worse than any other tool, an axe, shovel or anything. A gun is as good or as bad as the man using it.\n\nThere is an obvious attraction, and perhaps a history, between Shane and Marian. She tells Shane that they would be better off if there weren't any guns in the valley, including his. She is emphatic that guns are not going to be a part of her son's life.\n\nAs tensions mount, Ryker hires Jack Wilson (Jack Palance), an unscrupulous, psychopathic gunslinger, who laughs at the thought of murder. Wilson goads ex-Confederate Frank 'Stonewall' Torrey (Elisha Cook, Jr.), a hot-tempered Alabama homesteader, into a fight by insinuating that his nickname besmirches the honor of the war hero. Just before Stonewall is gunned down, he calls Wilson a &quot;low-down, lying Yankee.&quot; Wilson responds &quot;Prove it,&quot; before outdrawing the inexperienced homesteader.\n\nAfter the funeral, many plan to leave. But a fire set by Ryker's men spurs them into pulling together to put it out, rather than driving them out.\n\nRyker decides to have Wilson kill Starrett in an ambush at the saloon, under the pretense of negotiating. Calloway loses his stomach for this, and warns Shane that Starrett's &quot;up against a stacked deck.&quot;\n\nJoe is resolved to go anyway. He knows that Shane will look after Marian and Joey if he doesn't survive. But Shane tells Joe he's no match for Wilson, although he might be a match for Ryker. They fight and Shane has to knock him unconscious. Joey yells at Shane for pistol whipping his father with the butt of his gun.\n\nMarian begs Shane not to go and asks if he is doing it for her. He admits that he is, and for Joey, and all the decent people who want a chance to live and grow up there.\n\nIn town, Shane walks into the saloon. Shane tells Ryker that they're both relics of the Old West, but Ryker hasn realized it yet. Shane then begins to goad Wilson. He tells Wilson he's heard Wilson is a &quot;low-down, Yankee liar.&quot; Wilson grins, apparently remembering the last words of Stonewall Torrey, whom Wilson killed earlier. Wilson, as with Torrey, replies &quot;Prove it.&quot; Shane rapidly fires twice killing Wilson, turns and fires a third shot killing Ryker, who has pulled a hidden gun. He's turning to leave when Ryker's brother, Morgan, fires a Winchester rifle from the balcony overhead. Joey, who ran after Shane, calls out and Shane fires back, killing the second Ryker.\n\nShane walks out of the saloon, where Joey is waiting for him. He says that he has to move on and tells him to take care of his family. Shane also says to tell Joey's mother that there &quot;aren't any more guns in the valley.&quot;\n\nShane's blood runs onto Joey's hands when he reaches up to him. Joey's worried, but Shane tells him that's fine. Wounded, Shane sits up, with his arm hanging uselessly at his side as he rides past the grave markers on Cemetery Hill, and out of town, into the sunrise, over the mountains, all the while Joey is shouting the iconic, &quot;Shane! Come back!&quot;\n\nPRODUCTION NOTES:-\nAlthough the film is fiction, elements of the setting are derived from Wyoming's Johnson County War (1892).[4] The physical setting is the high plains near Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and many shots feature the Grand Teton massif looming in the near distance. Other filming took place at Paramount Studios in Hollywood, California.\n\nDirector George Stevens originally cast Montgomery Clift as Shane, William Holden as Joe Starrett; when they both proved unavailable, the film was nearly abandoned. Stevens asked studio head Y. Frank Freeman for a list of available actors with current contracts. Within three minutes, he chose Alan Ladd, Van Heflin and Jean Arthur, though Arthur was not the first choice to play Marian; Katharine Hepburn was originally considered for the role. Even though she had not made a picture in five years, Arthur accepted the part at the request of George Stevens with whom she had worked in two earlier films, The Talk of the Town (1942) and The More the Merrier (1943) for which she received her only Oscar nomination. \n\nShane marked her last film appearance (when the film was shot she was 50 years old, significantly older than her two male co-stars), although she later appeared in theater and a short-lived television series.\n\nAlthough the film was made between July and October 1951, it was not released until 1953 due to director Stevens' extensive editing. The film cost so much to make that at one point, Paramount negotiated its sale to Howard Hughes, who later pulled out of the arrangement.[citation needed] The studio felt the film would never recoup its costs, though it ended up making a significant profit. Another story[specify] reported that Paramount was going to release the film as &quot;just another western&quot; until Hughes watched a rough cut of the film and offered to buy it on the spot from Paramount for his RKO Radio Pictures. Hughes' offer made Paramount reconsider the film for a major release.\n\nJack Palance had problems with horses and Alan Ladd with guns. The scene where Shane practices shooting in front of Joey required 116 takes.[citation needed] A scene where Jack Palance (credited as Walter Jack Palance) mounts his horse was actually a shot of him dismounting, but played in reverse. As well, the original planned introduction of Wilson galloping into town was replaced with him simply walking in on his horse, which was noted as improving the entrance by making him seem more threatening.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 4999 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages:English\nRunTime 118 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 118 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41135e1993132c51d2c0e7ffc861b5ee5a257f66","amp;dn":"Shane+%281952%29+DVD5+-+Alan+Ladd%2C+Jack+Palance+Classic+Western+%5BDDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41135e1993132c51d2c0e7ffc861b5ee5a257f66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,19,94,25,147,19,44,81,210,192,231,255,200,97,181,238,90,37,127,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
