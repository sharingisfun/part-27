Among the first of the regiments to be raised were De BurghÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and the Scotch Brigade. These two regiments became united as the two regular battalions of the Connaught Rangers. As a result, the Connaught Rangers can claim a service record that streches back to 1572. This book explores the history, organisation, uniforms and equipment of the Connaught Rangers from the Napoleonic Wars to World War I. The unitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s experience in America and in South Africa is included. The full variety of uniforms are illustrated in a variety of colour plates and several contemporary photos and illustrations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47a6762c41539ebf9ff24f605a6174762ad82c26","amp;dn":"The+Connaught+Rangers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47a6762c41539ebf9ff24f605a6174762ad82c26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,166,118,44,65,83,158,191,159,242,79,96,90,97,116,118,42,216,44,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
