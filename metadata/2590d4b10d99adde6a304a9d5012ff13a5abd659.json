Dr. David Huxley (Cary Grant) is a straitlaced paleontologist juggling three important events at once: the arrival of an extremely rare bone needed to complete his brontosaurus skeleton; a meeting to ask for a million dollars for his museum from a wealthy donor; and his impending marriage to the humorless Miss Swallow (Virginia Walker). Into David's life comes Susan (Katharine Hepburn), a free-spirited young woman who seems to bring trouble wherever she goes. Thanks to Susan, David finds himself involved in one ridiculous situation after another, and soon the two are prowling around a country estate looking for the missing dinosaur bone, hunting for a lost pet leopard named Baby, and somehow falling in love. Grant and Hepburn form a sharp-witted and hysterical comic duo, and Howard Hawks directs BRINGING UP BABY with the control of a master, creating a shining example of brilliant screwball comedy.\n\n\nStandard version.
