Of course they weren't alone among popular recording artists in making concessions to disco during this era, and they didn't bury their African roots. It was still a somewhat dispiriting trend, and while much of the band's characteristic blend of African and Western influences remained intact, the songs -- all of them around five minutes long, and relying on grooves more than content -- were kind of blah. \r\n&quot;Celebration&quot; is about as close to a conventional soul-funk-disco track as the band got, and seems more like an Earth, Wind &amp; Fire outing than an Osibisa one. At other points, the elements get more eclectic, creative, and (by Western pop standards) exotic; &quot;Africa We GoGo&quot; is reasonably convincing Africanized funk. The Santana-esque traits that often popped up in the band's work are there to hear in cuts like &quot;Oreba (Magic People),&quot; especially in passages where organ, guitar, and chant-like vocals come to the fore. \r\nThere's too much of a preponderance of thumping beats, however, and it does not rate among the group's stronger or most representative albums.
