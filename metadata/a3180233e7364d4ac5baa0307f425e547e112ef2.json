Dodds was also the older brother of drummer Warren &quot;Baby&quot; Dodds. The pair worked together in the New Orleans Bootblacks in 1926.\nBorn in Waveland, Mississippi, he moved to New Orleans in his youth, and studied clarinet with Lorenzo Tio. He played with the bands of Frankie Duson, Kid Ory, and Joe &quot;King&quot; Oliver. Dodds went to Chicago and played with Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, with which he first recorded in 1923. Dodds (pronouncedalso worked frequently with his good friend Natty Dominique during this period, a professional relationship that would last a lifetime. After the breakup of Oliver's band in 1924, Dodds replaced Alcide Nunez as the house clarinetist and bandleader of Kelly's Stables. He recorded with numerous small groups in Chicago, most notably Louis Armstrong's Hot 5 and Hot 7, and Jelly Roll Morton's Red Hot Peppers.\n\nNoted for his professionalism and virtuosity as a musician, and his heartfelt, heavily blues-laden style, Dodds was an important influence on later clarinetists, notably Benny Goodman.\n\nDodds did not record for most of the 1930s, affected by ill health. He died of a heart attack in Chicago in 1940.\n\nIn 1987, Dodds was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame.\n\n\nJohnny Dodds - 1991 - The Chronological Johnny Dodds 1926\n01 - Bohunkus Blues.mp3\n02 - Buddy Burtons Jazz.mp3\n03 - Perdido Street Blues.mp3\n04 - Gate Mouth.mp3\n05 - Too Tight.mp3\n06 - Papa Dip.mp3\n07 - Mixed Salad.mp3\n08 - I Cant Say.mp3\n09 - Flat Foot.mp3\n10 - Mad Dog.mp3\n11 - Messin Around.mp3\n12 - Adams Apple.mp3\n13 - East Coast Trot.mp3\n14 - Chicago Buzz.mp3\n15 - Idle Hour Special.mp3\n16 - 47th Street Stomp.mp3\n17 - Stock Yards Strut.mp3\n18 - Salty Dog.mp3\n19 - Ape Man.mp3\n20 - Your Folks.mp3\n21 - House Rent Rag.mp3\n22 - Memphis Shake.mp3\n23 - Carpet Alley - Breakdown.mp3\n24 - Hen Party Blues.mp3\n\n\n\nJohnny Dodds - 1991 - The Chronological Johnny Dodds 1927-1928\n01 - Have Mercy!.mp3\n02 - Come On And Stomp, Stomp, Stomp.mp3\n03 - After Youve Gone (vocal).mp3\n04 - After Youve Gone (instr.).mp3\n05 - Joe Turner Blues.mp3\n06 - When Erastus Plays His Old Kazoo.mp3\n07 - Ballin The Jack.mp3\n08 - Grandmas Ball.mp3\n09 - My Baby.mp3\n10 - Oriental Man.mp3\n11 - Oriental Man.mp3\n12 - Sock That Thing.mp3\n13 - My Baby.mp3\n14 - Oriental Man.mp3\n15 - Jasper Taylor Blues.mp3\n16 - Geechie River Blues.mp3\n17 - Get Em Again Blues.mp3\n18 - Brush Stomp.mp3\n19 - My Girl.mp3\n20 - Sweep Em Clean.mp3\n21 - Lady Love.mp3\n22 - Brown Bottom Bess.mp3\n23 - Blue Clarinet Stomp.mp3\n24 - Blue Piano Stomp.mp3\n\n\nJohnny  Dodds - 1992 - The Chronological Johnny Dodds 1928-1940\n01 - Bucktown Stomp.mp3\n02 - Weary City.mp3\n03 - Bull Fiddle Blues.mp3\n04 - Blue Washboard Stomp.mp3\n05 - Pencil Papa.mp3\n06 - Sweet Lorraine.mp3\n07 - My Little Isabel.mp3\n08 - Pencil Papa.mp3\n09 - Heah Me Talkin.mp3\n10 - Goober Dance.mp3\n11 - Too Tight.mp3\n12 - Indigo Stomp.mp3\n13 - Im A Mighty Tight Woman.mp3\n14 - Steal Away.mp3\n15 - Salty Dog.mp3\n16 - Forty And Tight.mp3\n17 - Piggly Wiggly.mp3\n18 - Wild Man Blues.mp3\n19 - Melancholy.mp3\n20 - 29th and Dearborn.mp3\n21 - Blues Galore.mp3\n22 - Stack OLee Blues.mp3\n23 - Shake your Can.mp3\n24 - Red Onion Blues.mp3\n25 - Gravier Street Blues.mp3\n- Hide quoted text -\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\nComments:  &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d1a6b4b4a6b4b4b9bea4a3a291b6bcb0b8bdffb2bebc&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nShare ratio of 5 or greater requested.
