Sigourney Weaver returns as Ripley, who awakens on Earth only to discover that she has been hibernating in space so long that everyone she knows is dead. Then she is talked into traveling (along with a squad of Marines) to a planet under assault by the same aliens that nearly killed her. Once she gets there, she finds a lost little girl who triggers her maternal instincts--and she discovers that the company has once again double-crossed her, in hopes of capturing one of the aliens to study as a military weapon.\n\n  Starring: Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, Lance Henriksen, Carrie Henn, Paul Reiser.\n\n  Diredted by: James Cameron.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 2hr. 17min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 688 x 384","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e718de84a20656166f6e2ea9fb6a285a2ca88758","amp;dn":"Aliens+%28+1986%29+%28Sigourney+Weaver%2C+Michael+Biehn%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e718de84a20656166f6e2ea9fb6a285a2ca88758","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,24,222,132,162,6,86,22,111,110,46,169,251,106,40,90,44,168,135,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
