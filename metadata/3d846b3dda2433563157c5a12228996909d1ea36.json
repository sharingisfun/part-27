I could've put the original EN-US release\nFMVs without the hardcoded subs, but this newer FMVs have far better quality and the subs aren't intrusive.\n\nThe game is compatible with modern OS/Systems. \nTested on Win 7 x64 Professional and Ultimate. \nNot sure if the reg files I provided will work on 32bit systems. May need\ntweaking if not. I don't have 32bit Windows to test the .reg file I made for 32bit OS.\n\nTested on i5 2500k@4,8GHz + OCed GTX 770\nTested on i5 2310m + Intel HD3000 (notebook)\n\nThe game, like the original, is compatible with joysticks. \nTested with Wired Xbox 360 Controller for Windows.\n\nTo exit the game, press F9 repeatedly.\nTo toggle between Windowed and Fullscreen, press F8.\n\nDefault keyboard control keys are:\n\nRun/cancel - V\nstatus screen - Z\nAim - X\nShoot/Confirm - Space\nMap - A\nUp, Down, Left and Right Arrows to walk.\nConfig - F5\n\n**NOTE**\nThe config menu has a glitch because of original spacing of japanese alphabet.\nThe FIRST OPTION is &quot;Key Config&quot;\nThe SECOND OPTION is &quot;Monitor Calibration&quot;\nThe THIRD OPTION is &quot;Audio Settings&quot; (Stereo, Mono, Volume, etc. Nothing you need to mess with).\n\n====Instructions====\n1 Unpack the file with the latest version of 7-Zip, use the password bioresi2 when asked.\n\n2 Use the provided reg key inside the Resident Evil 2 folder, according to your Windows version (32 or 64 bit).\n\n3 Launch the game with bio2.exe inside Resident Evil 2 folder.\n\n4 Play.\n\n====================\nI can seed @ 50Mb upload speed from monday to friday, from 8AM to 5PM (Brasilia time GMT-3) and saturdays and sundays only 0.5Mb.\n\nPlease seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d846b3dda2433563157c5a12228996909d1ea36","amp;dn":"%5BPC%5D+Resident+Evil+2+2006+Japanese+Version+Patched+to+English+%5BF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d846b3dda2433563157c5a12228996909d1ea36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,132,107,61,218,36,51,86,49,87,197,161,34,40,153,105,9,209,234,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
