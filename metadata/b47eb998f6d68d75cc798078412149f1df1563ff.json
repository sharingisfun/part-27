ELIOT (1888-1965) was the most influential poet of the twentieth century. He wrote with care and did not publish often, but his major poems struck readers like lightning. His early masterpiece, &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,&quot; summarized the romantic longings and diminished expectations of modern man, and launched him at once as an avant-garde poet of the first rank. Then, in 1922, &quot;The Waste Land&quot; exploded onto the scene, a dazzling and difficult poem that dramatized the rootless state of humanity, mixing personal revelation with the ruins of culture to create the most famous poem of the century. Later in his career, &quot;Four Quartets&quot; offered a soaring sacramental vision of history. All these landmarks are represented in this remarkable new collection, in Eliot's own definitive readings. Here is the voice that changed and shaped modern poetry in ways that still resonate profoundly.\n\n - - -\n\nFrom Wiki:\nThomas Stearns Eliot was an American-born English poet, playwright, and literary critic, arguably the most important English-language poet of the 20th century. The poem that made his name, The Love Song of J. Alfred PrufrockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½started in 1910 and published in Chicago in 1915ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½is regarded as a masterpiece of the modernist movement, and was followed by some of the best-known poems in the English language, including Gerontion (1920), The Waste Land (1922), The Hollow Men (1925), Ash Wednesday (1930), and Four Quartets (1945).[4] He is also known for his seven plays, particularly Murder in the Cathedral (1935). He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1948.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b47eb998f6d68d75cc798078412149f1df1563ff","amp;dn":"T.+S.+ELIOT+%3A+THE+VOICE+OF+THE+POET+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b47eb998f6d68d75cc798078412149f1df1563ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,126,185,152,246,214,141,117,204,121,128,120,65,33,73,241,223,21,99,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
