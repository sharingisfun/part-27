The news stirred the public imagination on both sides of the Atlantic and thrust the scientist into the spotlight of fame.\n\nTwo years later, Chaim Weizmann led a fund-raising mission to the United States and invited Einstein to join it. The mission traveled to New York, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Hartford to campaign for public awareness and support of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. This brought Einstein within the grasp of the American media. His lectures delivered in New York, Princeton, and Chicago, and comments on the Jewish presence in Palestine, made Einstein, on his first trip to America, one of the first media stars. In Albert Meets America, JÃƒÂ³zsef Illy presents a fascinating compilation of media stories of Einstein's tour -- which cover his science, his Zionism, and the anti-Semitism he encountered. As we travel with Einstein, from headline to headline, we experience his emotional connection with American Jews and his frustration at becoming world famous even though his theories were not truly understood.\n\nThis exciting collection gives readers an intimate glimpse into the life of one of the world's first modern celebrities and a unique understanding of the media's power over both its subject and its audience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f4e9f4cfd4f265fc673e45712470613aaff35bc","amp;dn":"Albert+Meets+America","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f4e9f4cfd4f265fc673e45712470613aaff35bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,78,159,76,253,79,38,95,198,115,228,87,18,71,6,19,170,255,53,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
