It was taken down fairly quickly.  The only Nine Inch Nails song on it was the already released Came Back Haunted.  The rest I didn't recognize.  But it wasn't Nine Inch Nails.  Some of it wasn't even very good.  But for the sake of clarity - it was not Hesitation Marks.\n\nIt was a full, single track.  I cut it up and put a better copy of Came Back Haunted where it was on the &quot;album.&quot;  The rest I just titled not  based on the Hesitation Marks track list.  So, yes, only one track on the &quot;leak&quot; was actually NIN.\n\n...Enjoy?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d03ef31441aa579a42ca5f55cbf03e12ef34ea46","amp;dn":"Not+Hesitation+Marks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d03ef31441aa579a42ca5f55cbf03e12ef34ea46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,62,243,20,65,170,87,154,66,202,95,85,203,240,62,18,239,52,234,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
