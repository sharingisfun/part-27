Now recovering from his injuries but tortured by nightmares he tries to stay on the periphery and persuade Rosie (Ruth Negga) to come home from London. When John Boy pays off a large debt, Darren yet again finds himself trapped and back under John Boy's control.\n\nStill spooked by the death of his brother Hughie, John Boy's drug habit is making him increasingly paranoid and erratic. Nidge, now John Boy's second in command and principle enforcer, is trying to juggle an always tricky personal and professional life. Trish is about to have a baby and Nidge must try to maintain peace as John Boy becomes progressively volatile. When a consignment of drugs is impounded by customs, it sparks a war with a rival gang leader Fran. As the crisis escalates, John Boy becomes unpredictable and dangerous; loyal to no-one including members of his own gang.\n\n\nIN THIS EPISODE\nAs Donna reports Siobhan's rape to the police, detectives figure out what happened to Git and prepare to swoop to arrest Nidge and the gang. Nidge is well aware that even if he can fend off the cops, it's now only a matter of time before Dano learns the truth. Caught between a rock and a hard place, Nidge struggles to hold everything together Ã¢â‚¬â€œ while tensions between him and an increasingly volatile Darren break out into open conflict.\n\nWritten by Stuart Carolan.\n\n\nCAST\nRobert Sheehan     ...
