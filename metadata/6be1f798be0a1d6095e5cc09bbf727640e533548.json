Nicole Sandler's sitting in today with the latest news and some great guests too...\n\nWith the shutdown dragging on and the debt ceiling default looming, Americans want to know what will happen if the tea freak Republicans do push the nation over the edge. Forbes columnist Rick Ungar will join Nicole to discuss the cartoonish Republicans, the actual consequences of a U.S. default, and the one thing Republicans may have right about Obamacare.\n\nJosh Eidelson of Salon will cover the neo-Confederate rage behind the shutdown, where the filibuster fits into the debt ceiling stand-off, and how Dems may be falling into a Tea Party language trap.\n\nFinally, since the news itself has been so grim, comedian and former Current TV host John Fugelsang will join Nicole to talk about something a bit lighterÃ¢â‚¬â€his viral debate with Jamie Kilstein about religionÃ¢â‚¬â€plus details on his latest movie 'Comedy Nation', which is being filmed in L.A. this week.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6be1f798be0a1d6095e5cc09bbf727640e533548","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+with+Nicole+Sandler+-+October+09+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6be1f798be0a1d6095e5cc09bbf727640e533548","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,225,247,152,190,10,29,96,149,229,204,9,187,247,39,100,14,83,53,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
