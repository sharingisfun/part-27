The frame story revolves around Dr. Sela Mathers, a Doctor/Professor of Literature who has been given the ability to help people by showing them fairy tales with a lesson about their life. She struggles with the fact that people ignore her advice and ruin their lives anyway, and begins using her ability to dispense justice instead (see issue #15 &quot;The Three Little Pigs&quot;). Sela's nemesis is Belinda, who has the same ability as Sela but uses it for evil.\nThe other portion of the story is a twisted version of a classic fairy tale. The fairy tales are often violent and end in depressing ways, warning the readers to change their lives or suffer a similar (sometimes, worse) fate.\n\n\n\nVolume #3 of ongoing series\nCollecting issues #13 - #18\npublished by Zenescope \nrecommended viewer - coview\nAll credit to original scanners and uploaders\nmore volumes to come\nenjoy!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5617e2e0fcd27f3a2782995ef643bd704922f78f","amp;dn":"Grimm+Fairy+Tales+%7E+Volume+3%5Bflynner19%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5617e2e0fcd27f3a2782995ef643bd704922f78f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,23,226,224,252,210,127,58,39,130,153,94,246,67,189,112,73,34,247,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
