Brown, Patricia L. Gerbarg, &quot;The Healing Power of the Breath: Simple Techniques to Reduce Stress and Anxiety, Enhance Concentration, and Balance Your Emotions&quot;\n\nISBN: 1590309022 | 2012 | EPUB | 240 pages | 901 KB\n\n2013 Nautilus Award Winner - Silver\n\nHereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a drug-free, side-effect free solution to common stress and mood problemsÃ¢â‚¬â€developed by two physicians. Millions of Americans suffer from mood problems and stress-related issues including anxiety, depression, insomnia, and trauma-induced emotions and behaviors; and most would prefer not to take medication for their conditions due to troublesome side effects, withdrawal symptoms, and disappointing success rates.\n\nDrs. Richard P. Brown and Patricia L. Gerbarg provide a drug-free alternative that works through a range of simple breathing techniques drawn from yoga, Buddhist meditation, the Chinese practice of qigong, Orthodox Christian monks, and other sources. These methods have been scientifically shown to be effective in alleviating specific stress and mood challenges such as anxiety, insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder, and many others. The authors explain how breathing practices activate communication pathways between the mind and the body, positively impacting the brain and calming the stress response. The enclosed audio program guides readers through the techniques and helps make these breathing practices an ongoing part of daily life","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6446b7a35bde94406bf1aecfa455947e1b132d9","amp;dn":"The+Healing+Power+of+the+Breath%3A+Simple+Techniques","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6446b7a35bde94406bf1aecfa455947e1b132d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,68,107,122,53,189,233,68,6,191,26,236,250,69,89,71,225,177,50,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
