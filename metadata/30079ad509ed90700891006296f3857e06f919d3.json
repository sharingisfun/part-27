All versions are set on one patch of street, hence the title. The plot is a bit soap-operatic, but there are some great arias.\n\nA lot of people have DL\\'d operas like Maria de Buenos Aires and Stage Sisters, so this one might also be interesting.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30079ad509ed90700891006296f3857e06f919d3","amp;dn":"Street+Scene+Opera%2FMusical+Ashley+Putnam+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30079ad509ed90700891006296f3857e06f919d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,7,154,213,9,237,144,112,8,145,0,98,150,243,133,126,6,249,25,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
