As his life  \n                    unravels, Shane uncovers a terrible betrayal by  \n                    those closest to him and must suffer for the  \n                    sins of his father. Hitting rock-bottom, he  \n                    finds the strength to make an important  \n                    decision. Now Libby and her mother are firmly  \n                    nestled in the Gallagher house, Frank    \n                    volunteers to paint Patty's newly converted  \n                    bedroom. In the pursuit of a bargain, Frank  \n                    falls and feigns injury, leading to a    \n                    potentially disastrous face-off between him and  \n                    Patty. Elsewhere, Chesney holds a house party  \n                    to get close to Sammy, but a promise turns to a  \n                    threat when blood is spilt, leading to awful  \n                    consequences for him and Carl.           \n                                                         \n                                                                                                \n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n                     \n                        Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fe898426ebcc64fe4c17529ba0956238b10bc99","amp;dn":"Shameless.S07E08.HDTV.XviD-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fe898426ebcc64fe4c17529ba0956238b10bc99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,232,152,66,110,188,198,79,228,193,117,41,186,9,86,35,139,16,188,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
