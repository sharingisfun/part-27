Data Bus, DB 4 Data bus is a subsystem thatwww.OSTROUMOV.co.cc OSTROUMOV IVAN transfers data between computer components inside a computer or between computers. Consists of Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Wire Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Information Packing equipment Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ algorithms and formats of data transition Avionics, Lecture, Ivan, 2011\n5.

Distributed analog architecture7 1950s, 1960swww.OSTROUMOV.co.cc OSTROUMOV IVAN Lots of wire, no bus Very difficult to modify electro- mechanical parts heavy, large space, many pieces Boeing 707, VC10, DC-9, Boeing 737 Avionics, Lecture, Ivan, 2011\n8. Distributed digital architecture8www.OSTROUMOV.co.cc OSTROUMOV IVAN Digital systems, heavy, slow, difficult to reprogram (AN/ALQ-162) Each component contains its own computer and memory Uses a bus between components (less wire) Each unit has a dedicated function Difficult to expand Boeing 737, 767 A330 (tanker), Tornado, Sea Harrier Avionics, Lecture, Ivan, 2011\n9. www.OSTROUMOV.co.cc OSTROUMOV IVAN Federated digital architecture9 Systens communicate via a 1553B bus Additions are easy, only requires that the bus controller be reprogrammed Can employ many buses to separate common equipment (ex : EW on the F-18 with its own MC) Avionics, Lecture, Ivan, 2011\n10. www.OSTROUMOV.co.cc OSTROUMOV IVAN Integrated modular architecture10 Interchangeable modules can realize diffrent system functions Permits on-board repairs/swaps, that can automatically reconfigure Avionics, Lecture, Ivan, 2011\n11. Common types of serial digital data transmission are:11 Single source-single sink. This is the earliest application and comprises a dedicated link from one piece of equipment to another. This was developed in the 1970s for use on Tornado and Sea Harrier avionics systems. www.OSTROUMOV.co.cc OSTROUMOV IVAN Avionics, Lecture, Ivan, 2011\n12. Common types of serial digital12 data transmission are: Ã¯â€šÂ¨ Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Single source-multiple sink. This describes a technique where one piece of transmitting equipment can send data to a number of recipient pieces of equipment (sinks). ARINC 429 is an example of this data bus which is widely used by civil transport and business jets. www.OSTROUMOV.co.cc OSTROUMOV IVAN Avionics, Lecture, Ivan, 2011\n13. Common types of serial digital13 data transmission are: Ã¯â€šÂ¨ Multiple source-multiple sink. In this system, multiple transmitting sources may transmit data to multiple receivers. This is known as a full-duplex system and is widely employed by military users (M1L-STD-1553B) and by the B777 (ARINC 629). www.OSTROUMOV.co.cc OSTROUMOV IVAN Avionics, Lecture, Ivan, 2011\n14. The major digital data buses in widespread use today in avionics are:14 Ã¯â€šÂ¨ ARINC 429 (A429). Ã¯â€šÂ¨ MIL-STD-1553B, also covered by UK Def Stan 00- 18/Parts 1 and 2 and NATO STANAG 3838.
