Categories are there to help you distinguish costs for food from recurring expenditures for rent and insurances. Visualize your cash flow so you might track down areas that allow you to save money.\n\nOf course, iFinance will import your existing financial data in CSV, QIF, OFX and MT940 formats. That way, your digital bank statement is integrated just as easily as the data from your previous financing software. In addition to that, iFinance mobile, available for your iPhone or iPod touch from Apple's iTunes AppStore, allows you to add spendings to your list right when and where they occur.\n\nRequirements\nMac OS X 10.5 or late\n\n\n\nKeygen courtesy of CORE\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e9ee7e7d2435d0150f2c1ce2e4f641004515c9e","amp;dn":"iFinance+3.3.10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e9ee7e7d2435d0150f2c1ce2e4f641004515c9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,158,231,231,210,67,93,1,80,242,193,206,46,79,100,16,4,81,92,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
