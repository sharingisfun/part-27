It was a forgettable piece of fluff that would be forgotten entirely except for Springfield's future stardom and the album made up of songs he would perform at the end of each episode. This great lost treasure of '70s pop was unearthed in 2009 on a reissue featuring Springfield's aforementioned hit. MISSION MAGIC, originally released in 1974, is actually a pretty magical piece of bubblegummy goodness. Unlike the usual procedures for an album like this, Springfield wrote all the songs on the MISSION MAGIC soundtrack, and he proves quite adept at cranking out hooky, fun, and simple tunes that won't tax your brain but will leave you feeling good.\n\n\nArtist: Rick Springfield\nAlbum: Mission Magic\nGenre: Rock\nYear: 1974\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
