On four songs he is joined by pianist Russ Freeman, bassist Bob Whitlock and drummer Bobby White, a quiet trio that allows Pepper to dominate such songs as &quot;Everything Happens to Me&quot; and &quot;Tickle Toe.&quot; \n\nIn addition, Pepper matches harmonies and wits with tenor saxophonist Jack Montrose (along with pianist Claude Williamson, bassist Monty Budwig and drummer Larry Bunker) on eight exuberant numbers including the earliest recording of Art's famous &quot;Straight Life.&quot; \n\nBut that is not all, for the second of these two LPs contains previously unissued alternate takes of all but one of the 11 pieces. Because Pepper and Montrose were in very good form during the performances, they are well worth hearing twice. \n\n\nTitle\n01. Straight Life 3:09\n02. Chili Pepper 2:59\n03. Cinnamon 3:09\n04.
