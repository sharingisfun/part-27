It has been said to be inspired by the gym scene in the 1985 film Perfect starring John Travolta and Jamie Lee Curtis but actually it is based on the gym scene in the 1984 film Ninja III: The Domination. The video was filmed in a dance studio in the suburb Deptford, London in the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile being interviewed by Chris Evans for UK Radio Aid, a 12-hour fundraising broadcast for tsunami victims, UK Prime Minister Tony Blair said: &quot;The first time it came on, I nearly fell off my rowing machine.&quot; Many politicians and family groups have pushed for the video to be banned, but there are two videos ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a censored one shown in daylight hours and a late night version which is uncut and features the dancers rubbing their breasts and one dancer slapping her own buttocks.\n\nThe video was the highest-downloaded music video of all time in Australia, downloaded over 35,000 times through '3 Mobile' mobile phones with 3G technology in association with the Rage music television show. Ministry of Sound presented the '3 Mobile' phone provider with the mobile equivalent of a gold record in April 2005.\n\nDue to the popularity and high demand for the video, a feature length aerobics DVD was later released titled Pump It Up - The Ultimate Dance Workout which featured the dancers from the &quot;Call on Me&quot; video performing aerobics routines to various popular dance music songs.\n\nThe video spun off a parody version called &quot;Call on Me (Part 2)&quot;, featuring an aerobics class of men instead of women, and the main character being female instead of male.\n\nThe Specs:\nVideo:  XviD 720x400, 25 fps\nAudio:  48000Hz MP3 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8285902651646471174&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8285902651646471174&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease comment on quality and seed back 150%","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64e23d7983570624ecb7fe45c4272d0c0840005a","amp;dn":"Eric+Prydz+-+Call+On+Me+%28Late+Night+Version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64e23d7983570624ecb7fe45c4272d0c0840005a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,226,61,121,131,87,6,36,236,183,254,69,196,39,45,12,8,64,0,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
