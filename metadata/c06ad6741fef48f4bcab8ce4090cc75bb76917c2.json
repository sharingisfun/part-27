Simply drag the files you need from the BetterZip window to any Finder window or the desktop.\n\nOpen Archives Without Extracting: Not only can BetterZip open archives without first extracting them but you can also search for a file using the iTunes-like interface. BetterZip can open and extract archives with the most common formats: ZIP, SIT, TAR, XAR, GZip, BZip2, RAR, 7-Zip, CPIO, ARJ, LZH/LHA, JAR, WAR, CAB, ISO, CHM, RPM, DEB, NSIS, BIN, HQX.\n\nCreate Archives: Simply drag files and folders from your hard drives, disks, or network places into your new zip file. You no longer have to copy all the files into a temporary folder first. The supported formats are ZIP, TAR, GZip and BZip2 compressed TAR, XAR, 7-ZIP, and RAR (using the external RAR commandline tool). Large archives can also be split.\n\nProtect Your Data: BetterZip can protect your data with a password and create WinZip compatible AES-256 encrypted archives. 7-zip and rar archives can also be protected.\n\nUpdate Archives: Add new or updated files to existing archives. Remove any file or folder from an archive, or even move files around inside the archive as if it were a normal folder.\n\nMake Archives Compatible: Strip Mac specific files and resource forks from archives for best compatibility with systems like Windows or Linux.\n\nWhats New\n\nEnhancements:\n\nÃ‚Â°Ã‚Â allow merging of folders and Ã¢â‚¬Å“keeping bothÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ when adding items that ,\nalready exist in the archive.\n\n* The Ã¢â‚¬Å“Open WithÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ menu is sorted and displays better results now.\n\nBug fixes:\n\nÃ‚Â° Fixed a possible crash when deleting an archive in the Finder while it ,\n was visible in the favorites sidebar.\n\n* Fixed a possible crash when using the Ã¢â‚¬Å“open withÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ menu with ,  \n unknown file types.\n\n* The percentage badge on the BetterZip icon in LaunchPad could get stuck.\n\n* In some cases BetterZip was not able to track moved or deleted archives.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\n\nIntel Mac, OS X&gt;6 or greater\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c06ad6741fef48f4bcab8ce4090cc75bb76917c2","amp;dn":"+BetterZip++v.+2.2.1+with+SK+Patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c06ad6741fef48f4bcab8ce4090cc75bb76917c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,106,214,116,31,239,72,244,188,171,140,228,9,12,199,91,183,105,23,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
