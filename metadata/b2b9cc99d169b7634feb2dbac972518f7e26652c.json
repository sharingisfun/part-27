But that test leads to a new understanding and inner strenght that changes his life. \n\nItÃƒÂ¢??s tough for a twelve-year-old to be rejected and scorned by his peers. It devastates young Stephen. He shares this humiliation with his parents at home. That night Stephen takes a faith-building journey during a dream. He travels through history meeting Jesus, Stephen the martyr, families about to enter the Roman coliseum, William Tyndale, Christian children in todayÃƒÂ¢??s Middle East, and others who dare to share their faith. Young Stephen&amp;#039;s view of the kingdom and his definition of &quot;Christian&quot; are revolutionized. He awakens and goes back to witness to his world, his trial of faith strengthened by the Body of Christ. \n\nStephenÃƒÂ¢??s Test of Faith is an inspiring challenge to all ages, a powerful tool for Sunday schools, the unsaved, classrooms, your home. This walk with faithful heroes encourages us with their historical call to continue following Jesus Christ when we are put to &quot;the test.&quot; People will come away with a sense of appreciation of the great sacrifices people in the past have made for Christianity and are still doing today in many parts of the world.\n\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: English\nRuntime: 27 Minutes\nMy Rating: 10/10\nQuality: 10/10 (DvdRip)\n\nPlease seed for as long as possible. Only if you seed, can I upload other Christian Media. The idea about me uploading the movies is for you to preview and decide for yourself if the movie is a christian movie or not. There are a lot of general movies which are marketed as Christian Movies. Any way I won&amp;#039;t upload any movie which is not a &quot;real christian movie&quot; even if it claims to be. \nPlease seed and let others also come to know that there is Salvation only in the name of Jesus Christ.\n\nIf financially possible, please buy the CD/DVD to keep Christian films in business. Christians Films are a dying lot today because no one is buying them. If Christians won&amp;#039;t buy a few christian films then who will?\n\nUploaded by Indian Christian\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2b9cc99d169b7634feb2dbac972518f7e26652c","amp;dn":"Stephen%5C%27s+Test+of+Faith+%28Christian+Movie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2b9cc99d169b7634feb2dbac972518f7e26652c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,185,204,153,209,105,183,99,79,235,45,186,201,114,81,143,126,38,101,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
