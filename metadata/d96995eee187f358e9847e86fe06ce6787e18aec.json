Fifteen years later, however, American airmen flew European-designed aircraft because American planes were woefully inadequate for service on the Western Front. Why was the United States so poorly prepared to engage in aerial combat in World War I?\n\nTo answer this question, Herbert Johnson takes a hard look at the early years of U.S. military aviation, exploring the cultural, technical, political, and organizational factors that stunted its evolution. Among the recurring themes of Johnson's narrative are the damaging effects of a chronic lack of governmental funding for military aeronautics and the disruptive influence of a civilian &quot;aeronaut constituency&quot; both on military discipline and on public and Congressional attitudes toward army aviation. In addition, the Wright brothers' patent litigation hindered the technical development of American aircraft and crippled the domestic aviation industry's manufacturing capacity. Wartime experience helped correct some of these problems, but the persistence of others left the postwar Air Service with an uncertain and stormy future.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 320 pages\n# Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press; 1St Edition edition (December 8, 2000)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0807826278\n# ISBN-13: 978-0807826270","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d96995eee187f358e9847e86fe06ce6787e18aec","amp;dn":"Wingless+Eagle%3A+U.S.+Army+Aviation+through+World+War+I%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d96995eee187f358e9847e86fe06ce6787e18aec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,105,149,238,225,135,243,88,233,132,126,134,254,6,206,103,135,225,138,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
