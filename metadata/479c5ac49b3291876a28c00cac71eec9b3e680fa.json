These original performances are from the band's 1972 concert tour of the United States, recorded at the L.A. Forum on 25 June 1972 and Long Beach Arena on 27 June 1972.  Guitarist Jimmy Page considers Led Zeppelin at this point to have been at their artistic peak, as is mentioned in the album's liner notes. In an interview he gave to The Times newspaper in 2010, when asked which performances from Led Zeppelin's career stand out to him now, he made reference to these gigs:      I think what we did on ... How the West was Won Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that 1972 gig Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is pretty much a testament of how good it was. It would have been nice to have had a little more visual recordings, but there you go. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the conundrum of Led Zeppelin![1]  For many years, live recordings of these two shows only circulated in the form of bootlegs, and even then only certain audience recordings were available to fans and collectors (for example, Burn Like a Candle). Though several soundboard recordings of Led Zeppelin concerts were circulated amongst fans after having been stolen from Page's personal archive some time in the midÃ¢â‚¬â€œ1980s, no soundboards of the 1972 Long Beach or LA Forum shows were taken, meaning the release of How the West Was Won was the first chance fans had of hearing the soundboard versions of these concerts.[2]  The songs from the two shows underwent some extensive editing and audio engineering by Page at Sarm West Studios in London before being released on the album. Some songs which were played at the concerts, such as &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot;, &quot;Tangerine&quot;, &quot;Thank You&quot; and a rare version of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; from the 25 June show, were left off How the West Was Won..\n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] LA Drone\n[02] Immigrant Song\n[03] Heartbreaker\n[04] Black Dog\n[05] Over The Hills And Far Away\n[06] Since I've Been Loving You\n[07] Stairway To Heaven\n[08] Going To California\n[09] That's The Way\n[10] Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp\n\nPlay Time - 00h:56m:06s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Dazed And Confused (Walter's Walk &amp; The Crunge Medley)\n[02] What Is And What Should Never Be\n[03] Dancing Days\n[04] Moby Dick\n\nPlay Time - 00h:53m:08s\n\nCD03 Track Listings\n\n[01] Whole Lotta Love\n[02] Rock And Roll\n[03] The Ocean\n[04] Bring It On Home\n\nPlay Time -00h:40m:51s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 938mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
