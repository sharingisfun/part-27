These experiments should not be practiced without extreme care; they are very dangerous (particularly those using white phosphorous, currently used by the U.S. military &quot;to illuminate battlefields&quot;). Recommended for chemical educators and stuntmen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4a520ab6a21122d02336a3fa9ba829d8e011709","amp;dn":"Chemical+Magic%3A+Chemistry+Demonstrations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4a520ab6a21122d02336a3fa9ba829d8e011709","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,165,32,171,106,33,18,45,2,51,106,63,169,186,130,157,142,1,23,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
