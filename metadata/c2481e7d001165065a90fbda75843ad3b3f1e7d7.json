At any given time, the brain is collecting, filtering, and analyzing information and, in response, performing countless intricate processes, some of which are automatic, some voluntary, some conscious, and some unconscious.\nCognitive neuroscience is one of the ways we have to understand the workings of our minds. It's the study of the brain biology behind our mental functions: a collection of methods--like brain scanning and computational modeling--combined with a way of looking at psychological phenomena and discovering where, why, and how the brain makes them happen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2481e7d001165065a90fbda75843ad3b3f1e7d7","amp;dn":"+Mind+Hacks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2481e7d001165065a90fbda75843ad3b3f1e7d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,72,30,125,0,17,101,6,90,144,251,218,117,132,58,211,179,241,231,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
