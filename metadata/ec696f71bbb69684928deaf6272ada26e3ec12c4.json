It reached #29 in\nthe UK album charts and #100 in the US. Disc one is labelled Hit and disc two Miss, reflecting\nthe first discs containing several of Gabriels biggest-selling singles.\n\nThe two-disc set is different in the UK and US because of the second disc. The second disc in\nthe US spans fourteen songs by Gabriel, whilst the UK second disc features fifteen songs. Only\nsome of these appeared on the US version. The UK version collects at least one track from every\nstudio album by Gabriel, including soundtracks, except for Birdy, which is the only album not\nrepresented by a track.\n\nThe album is an alternative to Shaking the Tree, Gabriels previous greatest hits album that\nwas outdated at the time of Hit\\'s release by thirteen years. Gabriel has not released any\ngreatest hits albums since.\n\nDisc Two [UK Edition]\n\n\n\n\n01 - Solsbury Hill (from Peter Gabriel 1 aka Car, 1977) [06:31]\n02 - Shock the Monkey(from Peter Gabriel 4 aka Security, 1982) [03:54]\n03 - Sledgehammer (from So, 1986) [04:47]\n04 - Dont Give Up (from So, 1986) [05:19]\n05 - Games Without Frontiers(from Peter Gabriel 3 aka Melt,1980) [04:19]\n06 - Big Time (from So, 1986) [07:24]\n07 - Burn You Up, Burn You Down (Gabriel,Neil Sparkes,Karl Wallinger) [02:38]\n08 - Growing Up (Tom Lord-Alge Mix) (from Up, 2002) [04:47]\n09 - Digging in the Dirt (from Us,1992) [03:03]\n10 - Blood of Eden (Radio edit) (from Us, 1992) [04:06]\n11 - More Than This (Radio edit) (from Up 2002) [05:23]\n12 - Biko (from Peter Gabriel 3 aka Melt, 1980) [04:57]\n13 - Steam (from Us, 1992) [07:34]\n14 - Red Rain (from So, 1986) [05:32]\n15 - Here Comes the Flood (1990 version) (from Shaking the Tree,1990)[03:54]\n\nPlaying Time.........: 01:16:01\nTotal Size...........: 473.76 MB\n\n\n01 - San Jacinto (from Peter Gabriel 4 aka Security,1982) [06:31]\n02 - No Self Control (from Peter Gabriel 3,1980) [03:54]\n03 - Cloudless (from Long Walk Home: Music from the Rabbit-Proof Fence,2002) [04:47]\n04 - The Rhythm of the Heat (from Peter Gabriel 4 aka Security, 1982) [05:19]\n05 - I Have the Touch (Robbie Robertson Mix) (from Soundtrack from Phenomenon, 1996) [04:19]\n06 - I Grieve (from Up, 2002) [07:24]\n07 - D.I.Y.
