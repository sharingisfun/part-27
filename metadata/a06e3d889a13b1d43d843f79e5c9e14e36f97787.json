This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown I recorded last year and got no extras:\n\nThis is the first countdown in nine months with no recording by the Bee Gees, but they did write three of the songs in the countdown.\n\nA listener wants to know who has had the biggest hit of a remake that the artist had already hit with before. Casey says there is a tie between two different acts, and gives the details.\n\nCasey tells how one artist in the countdown got into a fight with Buford Pusser, the real life Sheriff whose story was told in the 1973 film, &quot;Walking Tall.&quot;\n\nAnother listener wants to know who has had the most songs on the chart at the same time and in the top 10 at the same time. Casey says there is a four-way tie for most songs in the top 10, and declares the Beatles to have had the most songs on the chart simultaneously.\n\nThere is a song by an artist whose album stayed on the album chart for nine and a half years.\n\nThere is a song by only the third artist in chart history to have his first 10 singles hit the top 40.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;Has there ever been a top 10 hit in the rock era by a family act which included the mother and the father?&quot; Casey says no but tells of a mother and her kids as well as a father and his three daughters who did hit.\n\n40: Warm Ride Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rare Earth\n39: Grease Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Frankie Valli\n38: Everybody Dance Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Chic\n37: Only The Good Die Young Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Billy Joel\n36: This Time I'm In It For Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Player\n35: Disco Inferno Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Trammps\n34: I Can't Stand The Rain Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Eruption\n33: Wonderful Tonight Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Eric Clapton\n32: Cheeseburger In Paradise Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jimmy Buffet\n31: Miss You Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rolling Stones\n30: Almost Summer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Celebration (w/Mike Love)\n29: Follow You, Follow Me Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Genesis\n28: I Was Only Joking Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rod Stewart\n27: The Closer I Get To You Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Roberta Flack &amp; Donny Hathaway\n26: Baby Hold On Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Eddie Money\n25: Oh What A Night For Dancing - Barry White\n24: Heartless - Heart\n23: Last Dance Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Donna Summer\n22: Even Now Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Barry Manilow\n21: You're The Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Seals &amp; Crofts\n20: Bluer Then Blue Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Michael Johnson\n19: Deacon Blues Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Steely Dan\n18: Every Kind Of People Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Robert Palmer\n17: With A Little Luck Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Wings\n16: Still The Same Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bob Seger\n15: Because The Night Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Patty Smythe Group\n14: Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Meat Loaf\n13: The Groove Line Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Heat Wave\n12: Used To Be My Girl Ã¢â‚¬â€œ O'Jays\n11: Dance With Me Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Peter Brown\n10: Love Is Like Oxygen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sweet\n9: You Belong To Me Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Carly Simon\n8: On Broadway Ã¢â‚¬â€œ George Benson\n7: Feels So Good Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Chuck Mangione\n6: Take A Chance On Me Ã¢â‚¬â€œ ABBA\n5: Too Much Too Little Too Late Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Johnny Mathis &amp; Denise Williams\n4: It's A Heartache Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bonnie Tyler\n3: Baker Street Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jerry Rafferty\n2: Grease Ã¢â‚¬â€œ John Travolta &amp; Olivia Newton-John\n1: Shadow Dancin' Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Andy Gibb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a06e3d889a13b1d43d843f79e5c9e14e36f97787","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1978_June_17th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a06e3d889a13b1d43d843f79e5c9e14e36f97787","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,110,61,136,154,19,177,212,61,132,63,121,229,201,225,78,54,249,119,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
