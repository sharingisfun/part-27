Longtime Thelonious Monk associate saxophonist Charlie Rouse teamed with bassist Buster Williams and drummer Ben Riley to perform Monk's material, with pianist Kenny Barron capably handling the keyboard duties. The group cut this album live in the mid-'80s and were recorded by the Red label. It was the only time this fine quartet was caught in a live setting during their tenure. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Dual Force\n02 - Beautiful Friendship\n03 - Scratch\n04 - Tayamisha\n05 - Spiral\n06 - Well, You Needn't\n\nPersonnel:\nBEN RILEY, Drums\nKENNY BARRON, Piano\nBUSTER WILLIAMS, Bass\nCHARLIE ROUSE, Tenor Saxophone.\n\nEnjoy and share!
