So the release of By Request compilation of cover versions in 1999 came as no real surprise, then. What is a surprise, however, is the amount of emotion and pathos Ronan and co-manage to invest in songs like Cat Stevens' &quot;Father &amp; Son&quot; and Tracy Chapman's &quot;Baby Can I Hold You&quot;--far exceeding the brief most boy bands have of merely smiling sweetly at the camera and making sure the dance steps are inch perfect. Musically, all the songs here veer towards the brand of harmony-laden, lightweight dance-pop Boyzone have virtually claimed for their own. --Everett True\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] I Love The Way You Love Me\n[02] No Matter What\n[03] All That I Need\n[04] Baby Can I Hold You\n[05] Picture Of You\n[06] Isn't It A Wonder\n[07] A Different Beat\n[08] Words\n[09] Father And Son\n[10] So Good\n[11] Coming Home Now\n[12] Key To My Life\n[13] Love Me For A Reason\n[14] When The Going Gets Tough\n[15] You Needed Me\n[16] When You Say Nothing At All\t- Ronan Keaking\n[17] All The Time In The World\n[18] I'll Never Not Need You\n[19] Mystical Experience\n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 01h:11m:08s\n\nTotal Folder File Size\t- 178mb (Including mp3, Art Covers &amp; Booklet, word doc)\n\nTotal Mp3 Bit Rate \t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type    \t- I-Tunes Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop\n\nOriginal CD Ripper \t- only1joe\n\nOriginal CD Uploader\t- only1joe\n\nOriginally Released\t- 25 May 1998\n\nRecords Company    \t- Universal Music\n\nArtists Website    \t- http://www.boyzonetour.com \n\t\t\t- http://www.boyzone.net \n\t\t\t- http://twitter.com/therealboyzone \n\t\t\t- http://www.facebook.com/pages/Boyzone/21917578110 \n\n\n* * * PLEASE SEED TO A RATIO OF 1:1 OR GREATER * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢LL ONLY RE-SEED IF THERE IS MORE THAN 10 PEERS WAITING * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1829922a1688a65207c3390af58cc1a15d2f754b","amp;dn":"%5B1999%5D+By+Request+-+Boyzone+-+178mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1829922a1688a65207c3390af58cc1a15d2f754b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,41,146,42,22,136,166,82,7,195,57,10,245,140,193,161,93,47,117,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
