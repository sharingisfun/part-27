The set contains portions of live concerts from the years 1974-1977 with an amazing 7 bonus tracks not on the original lp version. \r\n\r\nThe second disk contains an inspired performance of their entire &quot;Snow Goose&quot; lp with the London Symphony Orchestra. &quot;Snow Goose&quot; was arguably the band's best album. The early period of Camel which appeared on their first four albums featured Andrew Latimer on guitar, flute and vocals, Peter Bardens on keyboards and vocals, Doug Ferguson on bass and vocals and Andy Ward on drums and vocals. After their &quot;Moonmadness&quot; album Doug Ferguson left the band to be replaced by bassit Richard Sinclair from Caravan and Mel Collins from King Crimson was also added on saxophone and flute. \r\n\r\nThis early period of the band tended to focus on instrumental material with a few vocals added. After the &quot;Snow Goose&quot; album Decca increased pressure on the band to include more vocals for commercial appeal. Highlights of the disk are many. The &quot;Snow Goose&quot; material mentioned earlier and favorites like &quot;Another Night&quot;, &quot;Lady Fantasy&quot;, and &quot;Chord Change&quot; are included. Andy Ward's drumming is solid but jazzy at the same time as heard in the great live version of &quot;Lunar Sea&quot; included here. The sweet &quot;Song Within A Song&quot; illustrates what lyrical writers Andrew Latimer and Peter Bardens were. \r\n\r\nThe disk also contains a version of &quot;Liggin&quot; At Louis'&quot; from Peter Barden's solo career. The band were fond of changing tempo and feel during songs as in &quot;Lady Fantasy&quot; when the song starts out soft and slow and later features some vicious guitar work by Latimer. He is one of a number of unsung guitarists from the seventies. His playing while lyrical and not overly flashy remains interesting. He reminds me at times of Jeff Beck during his quieter moments or Andy Powell or Ted Turner from Wishbone Ash with whom Camel sometimes toured. \r\n\r\nCamel's first four albums are highly recommended especially &quot;Snow Goose&quot; and &quot;Moonmadness&quot;. Each of these albums have been remastered with improved sound and bonus tracks. These 4 albums contain more bonus live material from the same concerts featured on this newly remastered version of &quot;A Live Record&quot; not available here due to time constraints.\r\n\r\nCD1\r\n01.
