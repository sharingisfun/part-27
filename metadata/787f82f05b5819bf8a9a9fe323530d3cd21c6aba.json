Highlight is the pre-raphaelite Isabella or 'The Pot of Basil', which was written immediately after he had completed Endymion and has something of the same adolescent sentiment. Keats himself referred to it as having 'an amusing sober-sadness about it.'\n\n(Kindly seed, and if you can't find a seed for any previous poetry torrent go to the folder 'Current Poetry Torrents' and follow the instructions on the pdf.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:787f82f05b5819bf8a9a9fe323530d3cd21c6aba","amp;dn":"Poetry+of+John+Keats+-+6+-+Hodder+Headline+Audio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"787f82f05b5819bf8a9a9fe323530d3cd21c6aba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,127,130,240,91,88,25,191,138,154,159,227,35,83,13,60,210,28,106,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
