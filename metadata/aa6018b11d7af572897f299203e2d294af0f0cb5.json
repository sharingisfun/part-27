With &quot;Tin Man&quot;'s wonderfully polished soft pop ease and the wispiness of &quot;Lonely People,&quot; the band was able to recapture the same formula that put early hits like &quot;A Horse with No Name,&quot; &quot;I Need You,&quot; and &quot;Ventura Highway&quot; in the Top Ten. The difference with &quot;Holiday&quot; is that their light and breezy melodies and attractive folk-rock sound filtered through more than just the two hit tracks on the album. &quot;Another Try,&quot; &quot;Old Man Took,&quot; &quot;In the Country,&quot; and even the clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©-sounding &quot;Baby It's Up to You&quot; contain a sturdy enough mixture of guitar and harmony to rise them above inessential filler, at least as far as America's material is concerned. Cuts like &quot;Mad Dog&quot; and &quot;Hollywood&quot; suffer somewhat from trite lyrics and a seemingly hurried compositional formula, but this album as a whole ascertained that the group was definitely showing their true potential once more. The album that followed Holiday, 1975's Hearts, showed even stronger improvement, taking the overly catchy &quot;Sister Golden Hair&quot; to number one and scoring a Top 20 hit with the Sunday morning frailty of &quot;Daisy Jane.&quot;\n\nUnavailable on CD in the U.S., this is a foreign pressing of their 1974 album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa6018b11d7af572897f299203e2d294af0f0cb5","amp;dn":"%5B1974%5D+America+-+Holiday+%2B+Hits+%5BCDRIP+-+Flac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa6018b11d7af572897f299203e2d294af0f0cb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,96,24,177,29,122,245,114,137,127,41,146,3,226,210,148,175,15,12,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
