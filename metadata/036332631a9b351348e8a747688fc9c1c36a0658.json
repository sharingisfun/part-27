I praise Him for all His bounties. I ask Him to increase His Grace and Generosity. I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah alone, who has no partner, the One, Who Subdues, the Generous, the Forgiving. I bear witness that our leader Muhammad is His servant and Messenger, His beloved and dear one, the best of all creation. He was honoured with the Glorious Quran that has been an enduring miracle throughout the years.\nHe was also sent with his guiding Sunnah that shows the way for those who seek guidence. Our leader Muhammad has been particularized with the characteristic of eloquent and pithy speech, and simplicity and ease in the religion. May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him, the other Prophets and Messengers, all if their families and the rest of the righteous.\n\n\nAddress: The Rights of Non-Muslims in The Islamic World\nLanguage: English\nFormat: PDF\nPages:  81\nFormation : Salih ibn Husain Al-Ayid\nReviewing : Muhammad AbdulRaoof\n\nShort Description: In this study titled The Rights of non-Muslims in the Islamic World, to discuss this issue in depth, so that non-Muslims can know what Islam guarantees them, and not go to extremes in making demands that have no basis in truth.
