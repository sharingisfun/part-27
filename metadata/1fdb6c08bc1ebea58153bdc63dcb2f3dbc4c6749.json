There is also nothing more annoying. Who else can proudly insist that youâ€™re perfect while simultaneously making you question every career, fashion, and relationship decision you have ever made?\r\n\r\nNo one understands the delicate mother-daughter dynamic better than Kate Siegelâ€”her own mother drove her so crazy that she decided to broadcast their hilarious conversations on Instagram. Soon, hundreds of thousands of people were following their daily text exchanges, eager to see what outrageous thing Kateâ€™s mom would do next. Now, in Mother, Can You NOT?, Kate pays tribute to the woman who invented the concept of drone parenting. \r\n\r\nFrom embarrassing moments (like crashing Kate's gynecological exams) to outrageous stories (like the time she made Kate steal a cat from the pound) to hilarious celebrations (including but not limited to parties for Kate's menstrual cycles), Mother, Can you NOT? lovingly lampoons the lengths to which our mothers will go to better our lives (even if it feels like theyâ€™re ruining them in the process)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fdb6c08bc1ebea58153bdc63dcb2f3dbc4c6749","amp;dn":"Mother%2C+Can+You+Not%3F+by+Kate+Siegel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fdb6c08bc1ebea58153bdc63dcb2f3dbc4c6749","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,219,108,8,188,30,190,165,129,83,189,198,61,203,47,61,188,76,103,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
