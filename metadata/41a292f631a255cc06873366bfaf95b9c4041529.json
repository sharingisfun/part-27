Being happy is like &quot;having no problems&quot; and those problems are caused mainly by &quot;other people&quot; who want something back for their service, goods and solutions. So, here is the manual, solving the 'how' and the 'why', explaining 'good' and 'bad', not being the one and only method but explaining the two ways and helping you to make the right choices.\n\n\nThis is not a book about finance and money, this is about economy, the science of making choices. But OK, if you just read it to find out why you're always broke and how to get rich, that's part of the story too. The best investment you can make is in yourself (Henry Ford said that), so read, learn, find out and have fun, we did our best to make this a funny book, because that's what happiness is all about really, having fun.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41a292f631a255cc06873366bfaf95b9c4041529","amp;dn":"The+Road+2+Happiness+%28eBook+ePub-mobi-rtf%29+English+version.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41a292f631a255cc06873366bfaf95b9c4041529","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,162,146,246,49,162,85,204,6,135,51,102,191,175,149,185,196,4,21,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
