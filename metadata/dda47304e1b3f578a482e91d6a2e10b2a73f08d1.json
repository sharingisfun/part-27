Has Aliens left them behind as proof of their existens? Do they have information that will save humanity and prevent apocalypse?\n\n\nMany believe these skulls were carved thousands or even tens of thousands of years ago by an ancient Mesoamerican civilization. Others think they may be relics from the legendary island of Atlantis or proof that extraterrestrials visited the Aztec sometime before the Spanish conquest.\n\n\nCrystal skulls are not uncommon or terribly mysterious. Thousands are produced every year in Brazil, China, and Germany. But there are a handful of these rather macabre objects that have fueled intense interest and controversy among archaeologists, scientists, spiritualists, and museum officials for more than a century.\n\n\nThere are perhaps a dozen of these rare crystal skulls in private and public collections. Some are crystal clear, others of smoky or colored quartz. Some are actual human size and of very fine detail, while others are smaller and less refined. All are believed to originate from Mexico and Central America.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Dominic Frisby\n===========================\n\n\n\nProduced &amp; directed by: Paul Nelson\n===================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    The Truth Behind The Crystal Skulls\nYear.................:    2011\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    00:44:50\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3) \nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    1.950  \n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    624x320\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    2339 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A) \nFile Size:...........:    748 MB\nFPS..................:    29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2011\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\&quot;nfo\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                     ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD *****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n=============\n\nAfter my account accidentally got deleted i had to restore it.However if you click on DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT link it might not work for you.Use the magnet link(s) on my older torrents instead,thank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUPLOADER NOTE:\n==============\n\nBack to old skills:\n\n\nSince there were none proper avi file(s)out, i took the time to edit a proper release and share it with you all.On my uploads you'll never find rared files or \nmkv crap ,that can hide anything inside.Clean old good avi files and when possible \nwith srt(subtitles) included.\n\n\n* Adjusted the size down to 748 MB from 900 MB+\n\n* Removed the watermarks(National Geographic) and reduced the Width and Height\n  \n  to 624x320 pixels.\n\n* Changed the aspect ratio to 1.950\n\n* Slightly changed the saturation + brightness\n\n* (VIDEO)Cropped and adjusted the bitrate to 2 339 Kbps (H.263)\n\n* Changed to XviD/MPEG-4 from mkv\n\n* (SOUND)Kept the AC3 coding for the sound with decent 192 Kbps (bitrate).\n\n* Without losing to much i raised the framerate to 29.970000\n\n\n\n\n\n*** Overall a pain in the a..s ,but here it is.I wish i had more time\n    though so i could timestamp/sync a subtitle for it as well.Enjoy  \n    people.***\n\n\n                                                                             \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dda47304e1b3f578a482e91d6a2e10b2a73f08d1","amp;dn":"The+Truth+Behind+The+Crystal+Skulls-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dda47304e1b3f578a482e91d6a2e10b2a73f08d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,164,115,4,225,179,245,120,164,130,233,29,106,46,16,178,167,63,8,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
