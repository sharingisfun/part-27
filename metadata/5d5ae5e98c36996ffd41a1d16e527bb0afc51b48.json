In 2005, Perfect confusion was renamed Cage the Elephant. \n\n\n\nBowling Green, Kentucky, is not the first place that anyone would look for the next big thing in rock music. But the city most famous for Corvettes and Nappy Roots has spawned just that: Perfect Confusion. \nPerfect Confusion was formed in summer of 2001. A group of young kids heavily influnced by the sounds of 70's music and culture, they set out to create a sound that they couldnt find in todays rock genre. A sound that was raw and charged with a message. The five piece band immediately began performing and building a name for itself with a dynamic mix of groove, soul and rock'n'roll that's hard to categorize but easy to love. Singer Matt Shultz leads the band with a unique vocal style, lyrics and a solid stage presence. Bassist David Kem and drummer Jared Champion make up the band's powerful rhythm section. Kem's driving bass lines and Champion's funky, foot-stomping rhythms build a foundation for right-handed guitarist Brad Shultz's chomping guitar riffs and left handed guitarist Thomas Bullen's impassioned solos. Each song is a lesson on what five kids with a heart for music and a mind for change can do. \nIn the summer of 2004 after months of rehearsal the band went into the studio to record their first full length album. After several months of performing in venues from Lousiville to Nashville.\n\nPerfect Confusion is made up of five members, including brothers Matthew and Brad Schultz.\n\n        Matthew Shultz ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals\n        Brad Shultz ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\n        Lincoln Parish ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ lead guitar\n        Daniel Tichenor ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass, backing vocals\n        Jared Champion ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums, percussion\n\nTracklist:\n\n    1.
