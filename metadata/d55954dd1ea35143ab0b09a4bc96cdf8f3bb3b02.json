De Quesada\nPublisher:\tGreenhill Books\nDate:\t2006-04-14\tFormat:\tPDF\tLanguage:\tEnglish\t\nPages:\t256\n\n\t\t\nFrom Hitler's Wehrmacht of World War II to the Bundeswehr, the German Army uniform has changed greatly over the last seventy years. Through periods of glory, defeat and renaissance, the uniform has evolved. Prussian and Germanic traditions have remained strong throughout the uniform's history, and can still be found in the insignia and equipment of the present-day soldier. A provisional Reichswehr was formed in 1919, and, for the first time, the German Army had a common uniform for all the federal states of the Weimar Republic. With Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933, the uniform began to take on the symbols of Nazi Germany, the eagle and swastika being added. Post-war Germany saw a divided nation with two distinct uniforms, and today we again see a common uniform for a united Germany. Uniforms of the German Soldier charts this fascinating evolution. With more than fifty color photographs and more than 400 black-and-white photographs, this book gives the reader an unparalleled visual record. Each photograph is accompanied with a detailed, authoritative caption.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d55954dd1ea35143ab0b09a4bc96cdf8f3bb3b02","amp;dn":"Uniform+Of+The+German+Soldiers+%28+Illustrated+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d55954dd1ea35143ab0b09a4bc96cdf8f3bb3b02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,89,84,221,30,163,81,67,171,11,9,164,188,150,205,248,243,187,59,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
