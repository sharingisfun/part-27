Built by General Electric in Erie, Pennsylvania, it has a 3,690-horsepower diesel engine, though is still able to meet European Union regulations for diesel engine emissions. However, the Class 70 most distinctive feature must be its exterior cab design which is immediately recognizable. This is a result of built-in crash protection to protect train crews in the event of a collision, and in fact the entire cab was designed with considerable input from freight train drivers.\n\nWith a highly realistic drivers cab including working instrument and information displays, and sounds recorded from the real thing, the Class 70 is as up-to-date as they come and a great addition to your fleet.\n\nClass 70 diesel locomotive in Freightliner Powerhaul livery with accurate sounds recorded from a real Class 70.
