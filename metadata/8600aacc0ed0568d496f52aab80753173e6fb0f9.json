During the podcast (at 39:30) Glen and MarkÃƒÂ©ta IrglovÃƒÂ¡ perform the track 'Just Walk Away' which was not released on the album. This  song has been ripped from the podcast (using Audacity) and is included in this Torrent.\n\nTORRENT NOTE: This torrent should be downloaded and seeded in replacement of my previous torrent with hash value: 227F465E36C7BB3935FF14D42BE1F820522983F9 . The reason for this? Well when I created the original torrent, I do so including the 'Just Walk Away' track in various formats such as .wav, .ogg, .mp3 and .flac. I realise now that was stupid as the 'Just Walk Away' track was just extracted from the Indie-eye Podcast .mp3 file and then encoded to these various formats. But given the original podcast source file was an .mp3, extracting from it and saving the result in lossless formats like .flac and .wav was pointless as you cannot increase the quality of an audio file just by saving it in a lossless format when the source format was already compressed in a lossy format. For this reason providing the .flac and .wav files is a waste of space and bandwidth. Secondly I prefer to support open formats like Vorbis over proprietary formats such as MP3 so I will only seed the Vorbis file, if you want to convert it to an .mp3 for those of you using iProducts go ahead. Lastly adding URL shortcuts as files was also stupid so I won't include them.\n======================================================================\n\nFiles:\n------\n- The Swell Season - Just Walk Away (Unreleased 2006).ogg\n- Indie-eye Podcast - The Swell Season.mp3\n- The Swell Season - Just Walk Away (Unreleased 2006) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ AlbumArt.jpg\n- The Swell Season - Just Walk Away (Unreleased 2006).nfo\n\n=======================================================================\n\nPodcast Page Text (English Google Translation):\nSource: Source: http://www.indie-eye.it/recensore/mediacast/indie-eye-podcast-con-the-swell-season.html\n=======================================================================\n\nIndie-eye Podcast con The Swell Season\n\nBy: Michael Beech\nPosted August 28, 2006\nIn Folk, Indie, Personal guide, Podcast, The Swell Season, audiopodcast\n\nGlen Hansard would not need too many introductions, if this his first CD made ??a few months ago along with the Czech pianist Marketa Irglova, then out of the pen The Frames , had received the necessary attention by the Italian press as &quot;gender&quot; . The Swell Season is a project that has taken shape mainly during periods of low activity of the band of Hansard, through travels and small concerts together with Marketa between the Czech Republic, Ireland and the United States, Glen talks about exhibitions put up more for the sake of trying and to be present in one place, rather than a programmatic project, and yet, thanks to the attention of director Jan Hrebejk, Glen and Marketa are in a recording studio to record two tracks intended for the soundtrack of Beauty in trouble , the new film by Czech filmmaker that you can watch a special large format streaming portal at Cineuropa . From this recording session comes out with another line-up enriched by the valuable support of the Finnish Marja Tuhkanen on violin and viola and the French Bertrand Galen on cello; 14 tracks of which only 10 will form the corpus of The Swell season , title of a beautiful instrumental track on the album of the same name and direct inspiration from the work of the writer Josef Skvorecky, the same author who wrote a history of personal and beautiful of Czech cinema entitled All the Bright Young Men and Women . The rest of the film is the ghost semprepresente in this beautiful collection of songs crossed from the Jazz spirit of Van Morrison and a motor that drives the desire of the sound to the image and that of the word to the matter of sound. For this issue of Indie-eye Podcast Glen Hansard tells the sound experience of The Swell Season through all the tracks on the CD, and together with his valuable insight gives us one of the tracks included in the final version of the album, the gorgeous Just Walk away , a song threatened by incompleteness and repetition of a single verse, spiral sounds open on a folk uprooted, river and narrative. The Swell Season is published for Plateau Records and the Czech label Indies Records , from which you can buy the CDs directly.\n\n    Download Indie-eye Podcast with Glen Hansard from this Link [http://www.indie-eye.it/Podcast/swell_season_podcast.mp3] (40.3 mb)\n    Listen Indie-eye Podcast with Itunes directly from this link [http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=117311727&amp;s=143450]\n    Subscribe to Indie-eye Podcast through this Feed [http://lnx.impostore.it/indie_eye/indiefeed.xml]\n\nÃ‚Â© 2006 - 2010, Indie-eye REC.
