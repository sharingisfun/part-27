Additionally, several other album tracks became dance hits and received considerable airplay as well. These include the unstoppable &quot;My Lovin' (You're Never Gonna Get It),&quot; which combined perfect harmonies, street sass, and 1990s female assertion to create one of the biggest hits of 1992, as well as a catch phrase which became ubiquitous in popular culture. \nOther hits include their sophisticated, shimmering Top Ten remake of &quot;Giving Him Something He Can Feel,&quot; a ghetto love fable initially popularized by Aretha Franklin, the doo wop good-feelin' &quot;Give It Up Turn It Loose,&quot; the jazzy &quot;Love Don't Love You,&quot; and the hard rock smash &quot;Free Your Mind.&quot; The last was a hit which, following the summer of the Los Angeles riots, struck a chord with national audiences by coaxing people to let down their guards about racism and prejudice. Other highlights include the great opener &quot;This Is Your Life,&quot; the hip-hop tracks &quot;Hip Hop Lover&quot; and &quot;It Ain't Over Till the Fat Lady Sings,&quot; the house track &quot;What Is Love,&quot; the sexy, Middle Eastern-influenced &quot;Desire,&quot; and their wonderful, should-have-been-a-hit version of Curtis Mayfield's &quot;Hooked on Your Love.&quot; \nCombining sass, elegance, and class with amazing vocals and perfect production, this delightful set stands as one of the 1990s definitive pop albums.
