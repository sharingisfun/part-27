Issues 3-5 contain some of Sim's early, pre-Cerebus work, 'The Beavers'.\n\nAlso of note, Michael T. Gilbert's, 'E.Z. Wolf', a character that went on to appear in several of its own books. \n\nAlso, early Howard Chaykin, Dave Stevens, Sergio Aragones, Ken Macklin and, obviously, others.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04cc2157b65b81b9ef32ee6004769dffce8c64b4","amp;dn":"Quack+%28Underground+-+Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04cc2157b65b81b9ef32ee6004769dffce8c64b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,204,33,87,182,91,129,185,239,50,238,96,4,118,157,255,206,140,100,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
