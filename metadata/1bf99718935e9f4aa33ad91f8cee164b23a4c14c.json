How about your cosmetics? Do you know whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in the plastic water bottles you drink from, or the weed killer in your garage, or your childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pajamas? If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re like most of us, the answer is probably no. But you also probably figured that most of these products were safe, and that someoneÃ¢â‚¬â€the manufacturers, the governmentÃ¢â‚¬â€was looking out for you. The truth might surprise you.\n\nAfter experiencing a health scare of his own, journalist McKay Jenkins set out to discover the truth about toxic chemicals, our alarming levels of exposure, and our governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s utter failure to regulate them effectively. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gotten into Us? reveals how dangerous, and how common, toxins are in the most ordinary things, and in the most familiar of places:\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Our water: Thanks to suburban sprawl and agricultural runoff, 97 percent of our nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rivers and streams are now contaminated with everything from herbicides to pharmaceutical drugs. \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Our bodies: High levels of hormone-disrupting chemicals from cosmetics, flame-retardants from clothing and furniture, even long-banned substances like DDT and lead, are consistently showing up in human blood samples.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Our homes: Many toxins lurk beneath our sinks and in our basements, of course, but did you know that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re also found in wall-to-wall carpeting, plywood, and fabric softeners? \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Our yards: Pesticides, fungicides, even common fertilizersÃ¢â‚¬â€there are enormous, unseen costs to our national obsession with green, weed-free lawns. \n \nWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gotten Into Us? is much more than a wake-up call. It offers numerous practical ways for us to regain some control over our lives, to make our own personal worlds a little less toxic. Inside, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find ideas to help you make informed decisions about the products you buy, and to disentangle yourself from unhealthy products you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t needÃ¢â‚¬â€so that you and your family can start living healthier lives now, and in the years to come. Because, as this book shows, what you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know can hurt you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bf99718935e9f4aa33ad91f8cee164b23a4c14c","amp;dn":"What%27s+Gotten+into+Us%3F+Staying+Healthy+in+a+Toxic+World%5BiDeusEx%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bf99718935e9f4aa33ad91f8cee164b23a4c14c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,249,151,24,147,94,159,74,163,58,217,31,140,238,22,75,35,164,193,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
