The sinewy leader has a unique--and creepy--jail for master villains and she has her sights set on Riddick. And Jack as they cross paths with a ship of body hunters and are brought on board. The captain of the ship, Chillingsworth has an interesting hobby - she captures wanted criminals and makes living statues of them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:643ef0a29801b54298d533e2c211e51eb2d8c8c5","amp;dn":"The+Chronicles+of+Riddick%3A+Dark+Fury+%282004%29+DVD5+REATIL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"643ef0a29801b54298d533e2c211e51eb2d8c8c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,62,240,162,152,1,181,66,152,213,51,226,194,17,229,30,178,216,200,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
