Thursday is one of those bands. After\npenning a post-hardcore masterpiece in Full Collapse and breaking into the\nmainstream with War All The Time, Geoff Rickly and company revamped\nthemselves into a less abrasive, more melodic and certainly more experimental\nband with A City By The Light Divided. Their ongoing quest for a constantly\nchanging musical identity has again and again brought listeners to new\nrealms, and ThursdayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s newest opus No DevoluciÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n is no exception. A beautiful\ndisplay of a bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ability to evolve while creating a surreal environment\nfrom start to finish, No DevoluciÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n proves to be the most moving album\nThursday has penned since they gave us Full Collapse nearly ten years ago.\nWhat sets No DevoluciÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n apart from the records theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve released since Full\nCollapse is the success Thursday is able to achieve in creating a memorable\natmosphere musically. The bombastic opening of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFast to the EndÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is quickly\nsubsided by driving drums and lush, dense melodies. RicklyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gentle vocals\nmix well given their production to a slightly raspy output as well, giving\nthis album a very memorable beginning. From the first track, producer Dave\nFridmann does an amazing job melding the sounds this band cranks out\nregardless of the mood ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a sure sign of the comfort level built between the\nband and Fridmann over the now three albums theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve recorded together. The\nexperimenting with lush melodies continues in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNo AnswersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as a droning hum\npushes things along while Rickly again takes center stage. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA Darker ForestÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nbrings a darker timbre to the table, with eerie guitars and a snare-driven\ndrum beat building the tension at the introduction. When it resolves to the\nchorus, the melodies stay dark while the drums and vocals go to another\nlevel. What is strange about the delving into darker melodies on this record\nis that after listening to ThursdayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s split with Envy, none of this seems\nlike it was ever out of reach for these guys.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPast and Future RuinsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, a track featured recently on a split with Underoath,\nfeatures spurts of abrasion and melody between sections of driving toms and\nmoving keys. It also shows us one of the few hints of unclean vocals on the\nrecord in the culmination of the chorus as the fuzzy, grizzly vocals help\npush the chorus over the edge. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMagnets Caught in a Metal HeartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is more in\nthe vein of indie-rock, channeling crisp, yet delicate guitar melodies and\nechoed vocals to create a rather surreal sound that embraces the atmosphere\nit creates. Thursday even channels a somewhat industrial feel in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA Gun in\nthe First ActÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by their use of grimy programming on top of the off-kilter\ndrumming from Tucker Rule. The one true sidewinder comes in the form of\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMillimeterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, which harkens sounds of Flock of Seagulls more than anything\nelse. It takes some time to get used to (what part of this record really\ndoesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t?), but you could argue they own the song nonetheless. It all seems\neffortless regardless of the path they take, as Thursday proves to be a\nmaster at creating moving atmospheric backdrops for their melodies and\nvocals. If you were looking for a return to the past given the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s touring\non Full Collapse or even a rehashing of Common Existence, you will be in for\nquite a shock when your ears hear what No DevoluciÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n has to offer.\nOn their sixth time recording a full length, Thursday has never seemed so\nsure of what they were creating as they sound on No DevoluciÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n. It seems time\nhas only made this band more focused and realized, and the tracks here prove\nonce again that Thursday will not sit still regardless of what anyone has to\nsay about them.&quot;\n\n- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\nLink to large cover scans:\n\nLink to large liner note scans: http://img689.imageshack.us/img689/5745/thursdaylyrics.png","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6c9b867844d0e5f27898692fcd17de67262e903","amp;dn":"Thursday+-+No+Devoluci%C3%83%C2%B3n+%5B2011%5D+%5B320kbps%5D+HoTT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6c9b867844d0e5f27898692fcd17de67262e903","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,201,184,103,132,77,14,95,39,137,134,146,252,209,125,230,114,98,233,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
