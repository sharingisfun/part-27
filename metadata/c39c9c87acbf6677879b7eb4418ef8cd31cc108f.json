The film focuses on two close teenage sisters, Ginger and Brigitte Fitzgerald (Katharine Isabelle and Emily Perkins), who are obsessed with death. The title is a pun on the biscuit of the same name. &quot;Snap&quot; also relates to losing one's self-control, or a quick, aggressive bite. During the film's production, the Columbine High School massacre and the W. R. Myers High School shooting took place, causing public controversy over the film's horror themes and the funding it received from Telefilm.\n\n\n\nIs becoming a woman analogous, in some deep psychological way, to becoming a werewolf? Ginger is 16, edgy, tough, and, with her younger sister, into staging and photographing scenes of death. They've made a pact about dying together. In early October, on the night she has her first period, which is also the night of a full moon, a werewolf bites Ginger. Within a few days, some serious changes happen to her body and her temperament. Her sister Brigitte, 15, tries to find a cure with the help of Sam, a local doper. As Brigitte races against the clock, Halloween and another full moon approach, Ginger gets scarier, and it isn't just local dogs that begin to die\n\n\n\n\n\n[img]http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ea/Ginger_Snaps2_Unleashed_film.jpg[/img]\n\n\n\nUntouched DVD 5\n\nCanadian Edition\n\n16x9 Anamorphic Widescreen 1.78:1\n\nEnglish &amp; French Dolby Digital 5.1\n\nEnglish &amp; French Dolby 2.0\n\nAudio COmmentary with Director, and Producers\n\n2 TV Spots\n\nDeleted Scenes\n\nAudition Tapes\n\nBehind the Scenes 6 part Documentary\n\nTrailers\n\nStill Gallery\n\n\n\nBrigitte's on the run from Bailey Downs, and she tries to prevent what happened to her sister, Ginger, from happening to her by shooting up with monkshood. Eventually she collapses and the police that find assume the monkshood is an illegal drug, and she is sent to rehab. She is deprived of the only thing that will stop her from turning into a beast and killing everyone and everything in her way.

Alone and lost in the forest, they meet an old clairvoyant Indian that foresees their fate. Later, they are guided by the Indian The Hunter to a fort, and they seek for shelter with the men of the Northern Legion Trading Company. They note that the place is under siege of &quot;Wendigos&quot;, a sort of werewolf that has killed most of the dwellers of the place, and the survivals are very afraid. Their lives are put in danger by the deranged locals and by the surrounding beasts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c39c9c87acbf6677879b7eb4418ef8cd31cc108f","amp;dn":"Ginger+Snaps+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c39c9c87acbf6677879b7eb4418ef8cd31cc108f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,156,156,135,172,191,102,119,135,155,126,180,65,142,248,205,49,204,16,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
