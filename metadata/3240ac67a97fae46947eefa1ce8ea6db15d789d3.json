The series features strange behavior in natureÃ¢â‚¬â€specifically, the animal world. The series now airs on the Science Channel. The series took three years to make and a new filming technique was used to show animal movements in 3D.\n\nEach episode, however, tended to end with a piece about how humans are probably the oddest species of all. For example, in the end of the episode about locomotion, the narrator states how unusual it is for a mammal to be bipedal. In the episode about defences, the narrator explains that humans have no real natural defences, save for their big brains.\n\nAnimals and drugs. Cats on catnip, birds and aromatic herbs, apes and self medication, rooks, ants and smoke. \n\nNarrated by CiarÃƒÂ¡n McMenamin\n\n1 \t&quot;Marvelous Motions&quot;\n2 \t&quot;Bizarre Breeding&quot;\n3 \t&quot;Fantastic Feeding&quot;\n4 \t&quot;Devious Defences&quot;\n5 \t&quot;Puzzling Partners&quot;\n6 \t&quot;Peculiar Potions&quot;\n\n\nMore: http://jdp.co.uk/programmes/Weird-Nature\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3240ac67a97fae46947eefa1ce8ea6db15d789d3","amp;dn":"BBC-+Weird+Nature.+2002.-+%28Full++episodes-+6%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3240ac67a97fae46947eefa1ce8ea6db15d789d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,64,172,103,169,127,174,70,148,126,239,161,206,142,166,219,21,215,137,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
