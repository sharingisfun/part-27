If you were one of those requesting any of these Lps, I hope you enjoy it and help seeding. Now how I rate them:\n\nAcademy - The Collection  \n\n5 Stars!! I never understood why they did not make it big. Their sound was way superior over some &quot;mainstream&quot; bands back then.\n\n\nFlaming Mussolinis - Watching the Film [1985] \n\n4 Stars, some great songs here but gets 4 star for two songs I don't like\n\n\nPrivate Lives - Prejudice &amp; Pride [1984] \n\n5 Stars! Awesome and consistent througout the lp.\n\n\nThe Painted Word - Lovelife \n\n5 Stars! New Romantic at its best. What a shame they also remained so obscure.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33ec9cec5abd35341cbd300fc0bb04ba3250d792","amp;dn":"4+Rare+80s+Albums+%5BPart+32%5D+Your+Requests","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33ec9cec5abd35341cbd300fc0bb04ba3250d792","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,236,156,236,90,189,53,52,28,189,48,15,192,187,4,186,50,80,215,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
