Everything in the music is malleable, tempos are unfixed, ensemble roles\nare fluid, and most of what happens from moment to moment is dictated by\nwhatever the trio is spontaneously developing at the time, not by predetermined\nstructures. Karayorgis sets Ã¢â‚¬Å“Who Said What WhenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in motion with fast moving\nextended lines, with McBride and Newton capering right beside him. Suddenly he\ncuts off linear progress with blocky note clusters and the music disperses in\nspattered piano notes and scattered snare accents and widely spaced bass\nthrusts. The trio is interactive enough so that these frequent changes in\ndirection come not just from Karayorgis, but from anyone. Their empathy is\nstrong enough so that ideas emerge by mutual agreement and develop for as long\nas the group maintains interest in them. Then they quickly decide together to\ninvestigate another, usually contrasting, direction. This makes tunes like\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Correspondent,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Spinach Pie,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fink, Sink TinkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ radically unstable, but\nthe music feels unstrained and even lighthearted. Their approach to jazz\nstandards like EllingtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Mystery SongÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Warm ValleyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is equally\ndiscursive and free of literal historicisms. In fact, what theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve taken from\nhistory is not style or genre limitations, but a sense of possibility, a license\nto explore Ã¢â‚¬â€œ enjoy it as they do it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fc90d6a9fa6b64fe0a15504862c1e248d52995b","amp;dn":"MI3+-+Free+Advice+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fc90d6a9fa6b64fe0a15504862c1e248d52995b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,201,13,106,159,166,182,79,224,161,85,4,134,44,30,36,141,82,153,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
