Sutherland provides a riveting account of the French Revolution, explaining how its effects varied greatly according to regional economies, social structures, and religios affiliations. He examines how massive counterrevolutionary movements profoundly affected the course of the Revolution, leading to the failure of constitutional government and, ultimately, to an elitist dictatorship (in the person of Napoleon Bonaparte) that paved the way for many of the struggles of the nineteenth century.\n\nDonald M.G. Sutherland is a professor of history at the University of Maryland in College Park.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc1a6533912d9c80ce02764739cc6e7e6db2588c","amp;dn":"Prof+Donald+Sutherland-Understanding+The+French+Revolution","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc1a6533912d9c80ce02764739cc6e7e6db2588c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,26,101,51,145,45,156,128,206,2,118,71,57,204,110,126,109,178,88,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
