After the men strike out in KG's yard, they leave KG's disappointed mom and head to the hills of western Montana to hunt for some bigger gold. The men set a goal to raise at least $500 in gold for their local high school before midnight. Even with some help from a friend, the chance that the Diggers find enough gold to reach their goal is slim.\n\n&quot;Gilded Age Nectar&quot; - Outside Helena, Mont., George and Tim look for a lost camp of the world-famous Buffalo Soldiers, African-American cavalry and infantrymen who protected the settlers out West. They identify what they believe is the site after uncovering some rare coins, horseshoes and bullets. The Diggers search for riches and scandal in Helena at the Broadwater Hotel. In the 1800s, this Victorian hotel was home to lots of old money, and the Diggers are on a mission to uncover the riches that were left behind.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0f8ce640a2ce614bf2a6dc9716398960cd30227","amp;dn":"Diggers.Juiced.S01E01E02.WS.DSR.x264.NY2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0f8ce640a2ce614bf2a6dc9716398960cd30227","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,248,206,100,10,44,230,20,191,42,109,201,113,99,152,150,12,211,2,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
