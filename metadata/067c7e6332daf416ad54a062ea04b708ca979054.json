It was a huge success and went platinum in the UK, charting at number 6 in the UK albums chart during the competitive pre-Christmas sales. He wrote all 12 songs on the album, collaborating with a number of other producers such as The Misfits and The Matrix. Steve Lillywhite was executive producer and Darius himself produced the track Better Than That.\n\nThe first single Colourblind, was released on 29 July 2002 and went straight to number 1 in the UK for two weeks and was certified Silver. The second single Rushes, also did well, going to number 5 in the UK charts, and the third single Incredible (What I Meant to Say) went to number 9. The fourth and last single Girl in the Moon didn't do as well but still got to number 21. The album actually has 69 tracks, but after the first 12 they are all 5 seconds of silence until the last one, which is a songwriting demo of Gotta Know Tonight, effectively making it a hidden track. This songwriting demo has lyrics and music written by Danesh, showing the song as it was first written before other producers added their production ideas to the song. The album was certified platinum in the UK for selling over 300,000 copies.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dive_In&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dive_In&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRip from CD - Yes\nOriginal Ripper - Yes\nBitrate - 320\nSoftware - Windows Media Player\nCovers - No\t\n\nAll of the 199kb songs are silent, before the hidden track","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:067c7e6332daf416ad54a062ea04b708ca979054","amp;dn":"%282002%29+Darius+-+Dive+In+%28320kbs+-+123mb%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"067c7e6332daf416ad54a062ea04b708ca979054","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,124,126,99,50,218,244,22,173,84,160,98,234,4,183,8,202,151,144,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
