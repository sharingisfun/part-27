A motion picture of this concert, entitled AC/DC: Let There Be Rock, was released theatrically and on videotape in 1980, and on DVD on 7 June 2011.[1] However, the movie does not contain the performance of &quot;T.N.T.&quot; included on this album. The album also does not contain the band interviews found on the film.\n\nThough this album shares a name with AC/DC's fourth studio album, Let There Be Rock, it also includes live versions of songs from High Voltage (Australian), T.N.T., Powerage, and Highway to Hell. The cover used on &quot;Disc Three&quot; of the Bonfire box set featured similar cover art to that used on the international and current Australian editions of the Let There Be Rock album, and on the movie poster and videotape package of AC/DC: Let There Be Rock.\n\nIt is also notable that one song from the show, &quot;If You Want Blood (You've Got It)&quot;, is missing from both the theatrical and soundtrack releases. This song would be in between the tracks &quot;T.N.T.&quot; and &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot; as the first of two encores, the other being the title track.\n\nThe album is one of two live albums in Bonfire, the other being Live from the Atlantic Studios. Both albums are two of three live albums in an AC/DC rarity box set, the other being Live Rarities in Backtracks.\n\nReleased \tNovember 18, 1997\nRecorded \tDecember 9, 1979\nGenre \t        Hard rock\nLength \t        79:02\nLabel \t        East West\nProducer \tTony Platt\n\n\nTrack listing\n\nAustralian Version\n\n    &quot;Live Wire&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:04\n    &quot;Shot Down in Flames&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:39\n    &quot;Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:31\n    &quot;Sin City&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:25\n    &quot;Bad Boy Boogie&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 13:20\n    &quot;The Jack&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:05\n    &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:30\n    &quot;Girls Got Rhythm&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20\n    &quot;High Voltage&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:32\n    &quot;Whole Lotta Rosie&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:55\n    &quot;Rocker&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 10:45\n    &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:34\n\nAll songs composed by Malcolm Young, Angus Young and Bon Scott.\n\nIn the accompanying CD booklet, Mark Evans was incorrectly credited with playing \n\nbass. He was no longer a member of the band by the time the concert was filmed.\n\n\nNOTE:\n\nExtension File Format: mp3\n\nBitrate: 128 kbps\n\n\nREAPER\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f51ba1304c6cde2688c4c72455958f846fbc523","amp;dn":"AC%2FDC.Let+There+Be+Rock+%5BAustralian+Edition%5D.CD2.1997.Album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f51ba1304c6cde2688c4c72455958f846fbc523","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,81,186,19,4,198,205,226,104,140,76,114,69,89,88,248,70,251,197,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
