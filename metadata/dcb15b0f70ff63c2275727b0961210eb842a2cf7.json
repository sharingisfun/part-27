Based on past experience and this first wave of thusly-tagged rips, anything below 400 dpi (2,560 pixels wide, at standard aspect ratio) is to be considered &quot;ordinary&quot; and anything above 450 dpi (~3k pixels wide at standard AR) &quot;ultra&quot;.\n\nTo illustrate what the releases are actually like, I'm replacing the usual cover image by an interior sample here - a scaled-down page on the left, and a full-size detail from the centre of that page on the right, with the green frame pointing out the corresponding portions.\n\nEnjoy! :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcb15b0f70ff63c2275727b0961210eb842a2cf7","amp;dn":"%5BuHD%5D+Hack-Slash%2FEva%3A+Monster%27s+Ball+%282011%7CDigital%7CEmpire%29+%28Nem%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcb15b0f70ff63c2275727b0961210eb842a2cf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,177,91,15,112,255,99,194,39,87,39,176,150,18,16,235,132,42,44,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
