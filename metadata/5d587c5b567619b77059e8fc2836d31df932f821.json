For Steve and Lisa Morley itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the American dream or nothing for their 4,000 square metre block.\n\nThey love everything about the Hamptons style, from the warm timbers, to the many windows, pavilion style design, parquetry flooring and classic, soft interior furnishings. Lisa has done her research, designing many elements herself and will stop at nothing to fulfill her dream.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d587c5b567619b77059e8fc2836d31df932f821","amp;dn":"Grand.Designs.Australia.S01E06.WS.DSR.XviD-HDCP.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d587c5b567619b77059e8fc2836d31df932f821","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,88,124,91,86,118,25,183,112,89,232,252,40,54,211,29,249,50,248,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
