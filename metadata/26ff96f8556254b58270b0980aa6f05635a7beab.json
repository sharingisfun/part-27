That's it! With its standard settings you'll immediately be amazed at the added clarity and punch that your PC now provides.\n\nFine-tuning your audio settings is also an easy option. DFX has an intuitive interface with tooltips to guide you, along with a complete list of factory-tuned presets for all kinds of music. You can even create and save own custom preset.\n\nYou can also change the look of DFX by choosing from the many available DFX skins in the online skins library.\n\n\nAdvanced DSP Sound Quality Enhancement Effects\n\nSound Quality Enhancement Effects\n\nThe most important aspect of any audio program is how well it sounds. While sound quality can be extremely subjective, the general consensus from both reviewers and users alike is that the sound quality of DFX is exceptional. Read user reactions\n\nHarmonic Fidelity Restoration\n\nAdding Fidelity to your audio eliminates the &quot;muffled&quot; sound that is an artifact of the data compression algorithms used in Internet audio formats. DFX compensates for this loss of high frequency fidelity by carefully regenerating the missing high frequency harmonics in the audio. This harmonic restoration is performed using patent-pending technology that carefully synthesizes high frequency harmonics to replace the harmonics lost during the encoding process.\nAmbience, Stereo Imaging\n\nAdding Ambience to your audio compensates for the lost or diminished stereo depth that is the result of closely located speakers, poor listening environments, and sonic losses due to data compression of Internet audio formats. DFX compensates for the reduced stereo imaging and depth of PC audio by carefully regenerating the ambience and stereo depth. This same ambience processing has been used by Grammy winning engineers of artists such as Alanis Morissette and Ella Fitzgerald.\n\n3D Surround Sound\n\nUsing the 3D Surround Sound component adds amazing depth and body to your audio, compensating for monitoring limitations and sonic losses due to data compression. With 3D Surround processing the sounds will surround you, virtually putting you inside the music! 3D Surround enhances the sound played on conventional 2-speaker systems and makes even small PC speaker systems sound larger and richer. It is also fully compatible with Surround Sound playback systems.\n\nHyperBass\n\nUsing the HyperBass component adds deep, rich bass sound to your audio by compensating for the bass limitations of almost all PC-based audio systems and data-compressed audio formats. DFX does this by carefully regenerating the low frequency harmonics, thus increasing the perceived bass, but without exceeding the speakers physical limits, adding or changing speakers or amplifiers, and without increased power consumption. HyperBass greatly improves the bass performance of any sound system.\n\nDynamic Gain Boosting\n\nAdding Dynamic Boost increases the perceived loudness of your audio while minimizing distortion levels, particularly when using Internet audio systems. By adding Dynamic Gain Boosting, your playback system will sound twice as loud without losing any punch on loud passages.\n\nTypical PC-based multimedia playback systems and even home stereo playback systems suffer from limited dynamic range and headroom. Dynamic Boost compensates for this limited headroom by carefully processing the audio to increase the perceived loudness of the audio without altering the perceived dynamic range.\n\n\nSystem Wide Enhancement\n\n\nWeb Music &amp; Videos\n\n\nExperience richer, clearer audio on all the websites you visit: YouTube, Pandora, Netflix, Hulu, CNN, ESPN, Last.fm, Vimeo, Dailymotion, Facebook, Yahoo!, Google+, Amazon.com, Google Play, iTunes Movie Trailers, TuneIn, Grooveshark, MOG, VEVO, Rdio, Rhapsody, Flickr, Deezer, Slacker Radio, Jango, SoundCloud, Songza, Turntable.fm, iHeartRadio, SiriusXM Internet Radio, and all other websites.\n\n\nMedia Players\n\n\nExperience studio quality sound on your favorite movie and music applications: iTunes, Spotify, Windows Media Player, Winamp, VirtualDJ, VLC media player, Media Player Classic, QuickTime Player, RealPlayer, Rhapsody Software, JetAudio, GOM Player, MediaMonkey, DivX Player, foobar2000, KMPlayer, Songbird, BS.Player, JRiver Media Center, Pandora One, Last.fm Scrobbler, and all other media players.\n\nVoice Chats\n\n\nExperience clear and louder voices when chatting or web conferencing with people on Skype, Google Chat, Google+ Hangouts, Windows Live Messenger, Yahoo!

Speaker mode optimizes your listening experience through speaker systems. Headphone mode optimizes your listening experience through headphones.\n\n\nWhen in Headphone mode the audio is processed in such a way that the music sounds as if it is originating from a source in front of you rather than coming straight at your ears. This creates a much more pleasant and natural sound. It also reduces listener fatigue by eliminating the &quot;in your head effect&quot; of regular headphones.\n\n\nFinely-tuned Music Presets\n\n\nDFX is supplied with a broad set of easy to select processing presets that make it easy to find the settings which best match your audio system and listening tastes. You can also create and save own custom presets if desired. DFX lets you import and export your personal presets for backup and restore purposes.\n\n\nDynamic Sound Spectrum Analyzer\n\n\nWith the new Spectrum Analyzer you can &quot;see&quot; DFX audio enhancement processing at work. By displaying the sound frequencies of your music, it's a powerful tool which lets you refine your enhancement settings for optimum sound.\n\n\nPowerful Audio Processing Modes\n\n\nPowerful Processing Modes\n\n\nIn addition to our classic processing mode, DFX now includes two additional audio enhancement modes. The new Music Type II mode is specially optimized to enhance the sound of modern, high energy music styles while the new Speech mode is the perfect for films, talk radio and audio books.\n\n\nEfficient Performance Using Minimal CPU\n\n\nWe believe that no matter how good the sound is, it is useless if it bogs down your entire computer. Therefore we make it a priority that DFX runs as efficiently as possible. DFX uses only your CPU to do its processing, and does not depend on any features of your sound card or PC sound system. Furthermore, DFX uses minimal CPU power to do its processing, and can easily run on a processor as slow as a 133MHz Pentium.\n\n\nSo whether you have basic or advanced sound setups, DFX will be fully compatible and complement your PC audio.\n\n\nStylish, Shapely Skins\n\n\nLiven up your desktop by changing to a new skin. We have many to choose from and they're ready to download online. With so many great looking skins, you'll be sure to find something perfect for you. If not, you can easily make your own because we've provided easy instructions that show you how - and you don't have to be an expert to do it!\n\n\nSpace Saving Mini-mode Interface\n\n\nNew Space Saving Mini-mode\n\n\nWith the completely redesigned Mini-mode feature, you can save valuable desktop space without losing your most important sound enhancement controls.\n\n\n5.1/7.1 Surround Sound Support\n\n\nDFX fully enhances 5.1 and 7.1 Surround Sound audio content and is carefully tuned to provide optimal sound quality for each channel of all multi-channel Surround Sound formats. With DFX you can experience true theater sound quality.\n\n\n###################\n##               ##\n## INSTRUCTIONS: ##\n##               ##\n###################\n\n1.  Install\n\n2.
