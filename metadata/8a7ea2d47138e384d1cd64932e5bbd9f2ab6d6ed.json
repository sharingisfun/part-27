Following a career hiatus that she claimed reignited her creativity, 4 marks Knowles' exploration of 1970s R&amp;B, 1990s rock and roll and hip hop. The album is distinguished from her previous releases for its mellower tone and retro influences. Knowles served as executive producer and co-writer, with significant contributions from The-Dream, Tricky, Shea Taylor and Jeff Bhasker. Knowles' fans influenced her to name the album 4 for the number's prevalence in her life and career, particularly as the birthdays of Knowles and her husband Jay-Z, as well as their wedding anniversary. She began recording during her career hiatus in 2010, mostly in New York City, although more than ten studios were used internationally. In May 2011, Knowles submitted 72 songs to Columbia Records for consideration; the finalized album leaked on to the Internet weeks later. 4 was promoted in mid-2011 by television performances and festival appearances, such as Knowles' headlining Glastonbury Festival set. 4 was well received by music critics, who commended Knowles for her use of various genres and strong vocal ability; many publications included it on their year-end lists. It was Knowles' fourth consecutive album to debut at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, also reaching the position in Brazil, France, Ireland, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. 4 spawned the international singles[note 1] &quot;Run the World (Girls)&quot;, &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot;, &quot;Party&quot;, &quot;Love on Top&quot; and &quot;Countdown&quot;. &quot;Love on Top&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Traditional R&amp;B Performance at the 55th annual ceremony..\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] 1+1\n[02] I Care\n[03] I Miss You\n[04] Best Thing I Never Had\n[05] Party - - - BeyoncÃƒÂ© Featuring AndrÃƒÂ© 3000\n[06] Rather Die Young\n[07] Start Over\n[08] Love On Top\n[09] Countdown\n[10] End Of Time\n[11] I Was Here\n[12] Run the World (Girls)\n\nCD-01 Play Time - 00h:46m:28s\n\nCD-02 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Lay Up Under Me\n[02] Schoolin' Life\n[03] Dance for You\n[04] Run the World (Girls) (Kaskade Club Remix)\n[05] Run the World (Girls) (RedTop Club Remix)\n[06] Run the World (Girls) (Jochen Simms Club Remix)\n\nCD-02 Play Time - 00h:33m:06s\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time............. 01h:19m:36s\nTotal File Size....................... 567mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
