Is it a game, an interactive cartoon movie, or a simulation? The answer is &quot;yes, sort of&quot; to all the above. From a technical standpoint, it's a simulation. From an entertainment perspective, it's a software game. From a romantic or categorical perspective, it is perhaps an &quot;Interactive, First-Person Perspective, Graphic Exploration Adventure Simulation&quot;... but we couldn't fit that on the package!\r\n\r\n  From our somewhat stilted perspective, Spaceship Warlock is what we call an Interactive Movie. It's structured in a linear fashion just as any story with a beginning, a middle, and an end.  As an adventurer in Spaceship Warlock, the player brings his or her own morality and intelligence to the adventure.\r\n\r\nHARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:\r\nSpaceship Warlock runs on the color Macintosh II family of computers including\r\nMac II, Mac IIx, Mac IIcx, Mac IIci, Mac IIfx, Mac IIsi.
