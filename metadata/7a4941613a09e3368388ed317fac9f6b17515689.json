Police Chief Jake Russel\n(Chris Potter), a widowed father of two who is captivated by his new neighbor\nCassandra 'Cassie' Nightingale (Bell), who decided to move into the long-haunted\nGrey House for a spell.  As if that weren't odd enough to her new neighbors, she\nalso opens Bell, Book, and Candle, a wondrous shop full of unique items.  For\nsome, including the captivated Jake, Cassie is a breath of fresh air and a love\npotion that spreads through the neighborhood.  But before she can truly become\na part of her new town, she will need to win over some of the more skeptical\nneighbors who don't approve of her unique ways.  Is the town's new 'witch' the\nreal deal, or does her vibrant personality just have the neighborhood spellbound?\n\n\nAt this writing there are five releases in this series;\n\n2008-The Good Witch   (this posting)\n2009-The Good Witch's Garden\n2010-The Good Witch's Gift  (aired as &quot;The Good Witch's Wedding&quot;)\n2011-The Good Witch's Family\n2012-The Good Witch's Charm\n\nMy information says there is a 6th in production.\n\nI'm posting because this is a better copy than others here (deinterlaced 720x480 30FPS, unmodified audio), and I want to give back a favorite to the community, now that it's becoming hard to purchase.  Hopefully this first movie will give you a taste to seek the rest!\n\nHelp by continuing to seed, as I will stop after 10x sharing.  This is an original rip representing my first effort using video tools to convert my disk collection into media files.  This file plays fine on a WD Live Media Player and with VLC (Windows/Linux).  After several less than satisfactory attempts, I think I got it right!  (enjoy the show)\n\nRandomI.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a4941613a09e3368388ed317fac9f6b17515689","amp;dn":"2008-The+Good+Witch+%28Hallmark%29+720x480+%284%3A3%29+h.264+a52%28ac3%29Stere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a4941613a09e3368388ed317fac9f6b17515689","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,73,65,97,58,9,227,54,131,136,237,49,127,172,159,107,23,81,86,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
