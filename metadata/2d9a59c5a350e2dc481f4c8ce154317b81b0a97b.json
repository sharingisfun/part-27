We all deeply believe in everything JPG represents, but just weren't able to raise the money needed to keep JPG alive in these extraordinary economic times. We sought out buyers, spoke with numerous potential investors, and pitched several last-ditch creative efforts, all without success. As a result, jpgmag.com will shut down on Monday, January 5, 2009.\n\nThe one thing we've been the most proud of: your amazing talent. We feel honored and humbled to have been able to share jpgmag.com with such a dynamic, warm, and wonderful community of nearly 200,000 photographers. The images on the website and in the magazine were adored by many, leaving no doubt that this community created work of the highest caliber. The kindness, generosity, and support shared among members made it a community in the truest sense of the word, and one that we have loved being a part of for these past two years.\n\nWe wish we could have found a way to leave the site running for the benefit of the amazing folks who have made JPG what it is, and we have spent sleepless nights trying to figure something out, all to no avail. Some things you may want to do before the site closes:\n\n- Download the PDFs of back issues, outtakes, and photo challenge selections. We'll always have the memories!\n- Make note of your favorite photographers. You may want to flip through your favorites list and jot down names and URLs of some of the people you'd like to stay in touch with. You may even want to cut and paste your contacts page into a personal record.\n- Catch up with your fellow members. Our roots are in this humble flickr forum and we recommend going back to find fellow members, discuss the situation, or participate in another great photo community.\n- Keep in touch. This has always been much more than just a job to each of us, and we'll miss you guys! We'll be checking the account &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;563c26313a33222233242516313b373f3a7835393b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; in our free time going forward. We can't promise to reply to every email (since we'll be busy tuning up our resumes) but we'd love to hear from you.\n- Stay posted. Although the magazine is ceasing publication, we'll be updating you on what's happening with your subscription early next week.\n\nWe're soggy-eyed messes, but it is what it is. At that, JPGers, we bid you goodbye, and good luck in 2009 and the future.\n\nLaura Brunow Miner\nEditor in Chief\n\n\n\nIssues\n\n* Sneak Peek: Issue 17 15 July 2008\n* Sneak Peek: Issue 16 28 May 2008\n* Issue 15 2 April 2008\n* Issue 14 19 February 2008\n* Issue 13 4 December 2007\n* Issue 12 19 September 2007\n* Issue 11 20 July 2007\n* The Early Issues 28 June 2007\n* Issue 10 21 May 2007\n* Issue 9 6 March 2007\n* Issue 8 24 January 2007\n* Issue 7 12 December 2006\n\nOuttakes\n\n* Issue 19 Outtakes: Nighttime 23 December 2008\n* Issue 19 Outtakes: Faith 16 December 2008\n* Issue 19 Outtakes: Delectable 9 December 2008\n* Issue 18 Outtakes: Democracy 28 October 2008\n* Issue 18 Outtakes: Geometry 16 October 2008\n* Issue 18 Outtakes: On Stage 14 October 2008\n* Issue 17 Outtakes: Street Fashion 3 September 2008\n* Issue 17 Outtakes: Favorite Hangouts 26 August 2008\n* Issue 17 Outtakes: Creatures 19 August 2008\n* Issue 16 Outtakes: Fresh 14 July 2008\n* Issue 16 Outtakes: Human Impact 7 July 2008\n* Issue 16 Outtakes: On The Go 30 June 2008\n* Issue 15 Outtakes: Surroundings 30 June 2008\n* Issue 15 Outtakes: Split-Second 30 June 2008\n* Issue 15 Outtakes: Noir 30 June 2008\n* Issue 14: Fanatic Outtakes 5 March 2008\n* Issue 14: Emotion Capture Outtakes 5 March 2008\n* Issue 14: Bird's-eye View Outtakes 27 February 2008\n* Issue 13: Passport Outtakes 19 December 2007\n* Issue 13: Tools of the Trade Outtakes 19 December 2007\n* Issue 13: Gravity Powered Outtakes 19 December 2007\n* Issue 12: Creative License Outtakes 31 October 2007\n* Issue 12: Family Outtakes 11 October 2007\n* Issue 12: Fashion Outtakes 4 October 2007\n\nPhoto Challenges\n\n* Photo Challenge Selections: Ceiling 23 December 2008\n* Photo Challenge Selections: Umbrellas 17 December 2008\n* Photo Challenge Selections: Favorite Chair 9 December 2008\n* Photo Challenge Selections: Best Holidays Ever 3 December 2008\n* Photo Challenge Selections: Stripes 24 November 2008\n* Photo Challenge Selections: Lens Flare 18 November 2008\n* Photo Challenge Selections: Pumpkins 11 November 2008\n* Photo Challenge: Homage to Cinema 5 November 2008\n* Photo Challenge Selections: Dashboard 5 November 2008\n* Photo Challenge Selections: Mementos 28 October 2008\n* Photo Challenge Selections: Leaf in Hand 22 October 2008\n* Photo Challenge: Inside Your Fridge 1 October 2008\n* Photo Challenge: Morning Routine 24 September 2008\n* Photo Challenge: Hamburgers 17 September 2008\n* Photo Challenge: Title Me 9 September 2008\n* Photo Challenge: First Name 3 September 2008\n* Photo Challenge: Street Performers 27 August 2008\n* Photo Challenge: Guess What 20 August 2008\n* Photo Challenge Selections: Folded Paper 13 August 2008\n* Photo Challenge Selections: Items We Carry 6 August 2008\n* Photo Challenge Selections: Infrared 30 July 2008\n* Photo Challenge Selections: Splash!
