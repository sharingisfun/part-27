Plankeye's style could be defined as melodic post-grunge combined with indie and alternative elements. Their first few albums also incorporated a fair amount of punk rock elements, but this aspect faded when original singer Scott Silletta left the band.\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - April 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40693e9f675cd99874442daf9f0f38cf5766be85","amp;dn":"Plankeye+Discography+1994-2002+%2811+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40693e9f675cd99874442daf9f0f38cf5766be85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,105,62,159,103,92,217,152,116,68,45,175,159,15,56,207,87,102,190,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
