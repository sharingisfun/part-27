For over a decade they have managed to keep Nina imprisoned, using her to satisfy their every whim.\n \nWorse still, the only light in her lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€her 9-year-old son, SamÃ¢â‚¬â€considers Michael a hero. When Sam imitates MichaelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s violence by lashing out at her, Nina knows itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time for both of them to escape before Sam truly turns into the monster Michael is grooming him to become.\n \nAfter crashing her car in her haste to escape, kind motorist Case Herder offers her help. Unaware that he has his own plans for her, Nina accepts, igniting a deadly game of cat and mouse as they flee across Tasmania with Sam.\n \nAs Michael and Greg relentlessly hunt them down to Cradle Mountain, Nina finds herself with nowhere left to run. Cornered, she has no choice but to face evil head-on.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7989039b2034c2f83c6f35465f8c017ffe12e7c","amp;dn":"The+Devils%27+Cradle+by+Darcy+Daniel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7989039b2034c2f83c6f35465f8c017ffe12e7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,152,144,57,178,3,76,47,131,198,243,84,101,248,192,23,255,225,46,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
