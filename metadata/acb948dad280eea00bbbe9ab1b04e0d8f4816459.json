And in her new book, Help, Thanks, Wow, she has coalesced everything she knows about prayer to these fundamentals.\n\nIt is these three prayers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ asking for assistance from a higher power, appreciating what we have that is good, and feeling awe at the world around us Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that can get us through the day and can show us the way forward. In Help, Thanks, Wow, Lamott recounts how she came to these insights, explains what they mean to her and how they have helped, and explores how others have embraced these same ideas.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acb948dad280eea00bbbe9ab1b04e0d8f4816459","amp;dn":"Help%2C+Thanks%2C+Wow%3A+The+Three+Essential+Prayers+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acb948dad280eea00bbbe9ab1b04e0d8f4816459","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,185,72,218,210,128,238,160,11,187,233,171,27,4,224,216,244,129,100,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
