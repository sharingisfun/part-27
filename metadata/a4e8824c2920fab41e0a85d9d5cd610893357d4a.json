It is a diary of which we have to read every word...its faith is a poor thing but its doubt is a very intense experience''\n\nThis is read, very finely, in an abridged version by David Bamber (a BBC production from 2011). The atmospheric music in the background is wonderfully appropriate too. Kindly seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4e8824c2920fab41e0a85d9d5cd610893357d4a","amp;dn":"The+Poetry+of+Tennyson+-+4+-+In+Memoriam+-+David+Bamber","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4e8824c2920fab41e0a85d9d5cd610893357d4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,232,130,76,41,32,250,180,30,10,133,217,213,205,97,8,147,53,125,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
