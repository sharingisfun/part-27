The result will sound a little acerbic for some ears, especially those not yet accustomed to period performance, but there&amp;#039;s no doubting the conductor&amp;#039;s commitment to seeking out the very heart of this repertoire\nThe band, choir, and soloists are impeccable, of course. \n\nThe Paukenmesse, also known as the &quot;Mass in Time of War&quot; was composed when the Napoleonic War was at its peak; Haydn&amp;#039;s wild use of tympani in the Agnus Dei movement and the trumpets and drums elsewhere are a sort-of Viennese answer to the menace.Both are wonderfully symphonic. Gardiner and his period-instrument band, soloists, and chorus approach both works head on, with great energy and ideal voice-instrument balance.These are the versions of these masses which should be in your collection.\n\n\nEAC -----&gt; Lame mp3 @ 320 kbps vbr\n\n\nEnjoy &amp; ...... blah blah seed ^^ thanks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5487cd3e72960ce7c9fe000b17629b7832fc481d","amp;dn":"J.Haydn+%5C%22Theresienmesse+%5C%22+%26+%5C%22Paukenmess%5C%22+-+Gardiner+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5487cd3e72960ce7c9fe000b17629b7832fc481d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,135,205,62,114,150,12,231,201,254,0,11,23,98,155,120,50,252,72,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
