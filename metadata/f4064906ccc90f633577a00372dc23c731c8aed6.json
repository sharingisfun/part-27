THE Textbook of Small Arms, which appears to have been first printed in 1863, was a thin volume specially intended for Officers under instruction at the School of Musketry at Hythe. Reprints or revised editions, called for by changes in armament, appeared in 1868, 1877 and 1880. The next edition, that of 1884, was almost entirely re-written; it bore the title of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Treatise on Military Small Arms and Ammunition . . . a Textbook for the Army,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ by Lieut.-Colonel H. Bond, R. A., Assistant Superintendent Royal Small Arms Factories. This work contained abbreviated ballistic tables and showed the method of using them. A fresh edition appeared in 1888.\nThe adoption of the magazine rifle and a smokeless propellant made a new book necessary, and the name Textbook was again used in 1894 for an enlarged work. The next edition, that of 1904, was an almost completely new volume, double the size of the last; for this Captain W. B. Wallace, Inspector of Small Arms, was responsible; it contains some remarks on automatic rifles. A fresh version of the same book was issued in 1909, the ballistic tables being separately bound.\nText has been replaced, sentences and paragraphs moved together. The pictures were not very good, so I have replaced some.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4064906ccc90f633577a00372dc23c731c8aed6","amp;dn":"Textbook+Of+Small+Arms+1929+-+War+Office+Manual.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4064906ccc90f633577a00372dc23c731c8aed6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,6,73,6,204,201,15,99,53,119,160,3,114,220,35,199,49,200,174,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
