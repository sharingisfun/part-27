Walled by sheer 3,000-foot    \n         granite cliffs and made from one of the toughest rocks on     \n         earth, it is home to the mighty El Capitan and iconic Half    \n         Dome. Yet how this extraordinary valley formed has been the   \n         subject of controversy for over 100 years. Was it carved      \n          by gigantic glaciers or a cataclysmic rifting of the Earth?   \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n         Release  Notes    \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n         Yay commercial :(                                             \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n          Group Greets     \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                           CTU, ORENJi, 2HD, DHD                       \n                                                                        \n            and all other groups that choose quality over speed         \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n        \n       Contact Info      \n                                      \n                                        \n                                                                  \n       We are currently looking for:                                  \n                                                                       \n           * US/CA cappers with HDTV and/or DSR feed - min 60 kB/s      \n                                                                        \n         GROUP NEWS: No, we will not affil your brand new/DR/colo site, \n                     so please don't ask.
