The hotels are excellent, and the prices not at all exorbitant. The opportunities for fishing are not surpassed in the country; in fact, they are not even equaled elsewhere. Because, in other localities, certain places in the streams are much better than others; but at Niagara one place is just as good as another, for the reason that the fish do not bite anywhere, and so there is no use in your walking five miles to fish, when you can depend on being just as unsuccessful nearer home. The advantages of this state of things have never heretofore been properly placed before the public.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48b9cf5f56f06ea3fef1bb0f55e689e5c8147fea","amp;dn":"Ebook+-+Niagara+by+Mark+Twain","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48b9cf5f56f06ea3fef1bb0f55e689e5c8147fea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,185,207,95,86,240,110,163,254,241,187,15,85,230,137,229,200,20,127,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
