Written by the band members, the song was produced by Alex Sadkin, and the group's lead vocalist Tom Bailey. It was released in November 1983 as the first single of their fifth studio album, Into The Gap. The song is a new wave ballad that uses a varied instrumentation, including a xylophone, a piano and Latin percussion.\n\nReleased in the United Kingdom in late 1983, the song peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart in November of that year, and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in 1983, becoming the band's biggest-selling single, and their first top five in that country. The song was released in the United States in February 1984. It became the band's highest charting single, peaking at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 in May, and remained in the chart for twenty-one weeks. In addition, the song topped Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play chart for one week in April 1984.\n\nThis music video for &quot;Hold Me Now&quot; was directed by Rupert James, produced by Tim Bevan, and edited by Brian Grant, and Nick Morris. The video features the Thompson Twins in a set with a blue background. Each member is standing in a platform, singing or playing a different instrument, a guitar or a piano for Bailey, a xylophone or another percussion instrument for Currie, and a bass guitar or congas for Leeway.
