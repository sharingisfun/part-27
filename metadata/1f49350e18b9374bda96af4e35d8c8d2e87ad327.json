When a Heart Breaks Down\n\nOn June 2, 2013, acclaimed singer/songwriter Ron Morsberger succumbed to the brain cancer with which he been living for almost two years. When he died, we lost a brilliant composer and musician, but his light shines on through his music, continuing to brighten the corners where we are and shining brilliant rays to light our paths. When he was diagnosed with this terminal brain cancer in September 2011, he immersed himself in music and life, releasing three albums: A Part of You, a song cycle for his sons; Midnight Garden, a collaborative effort with Brad Roberts of Crash Test Dummies; Early Work, a double CD of material he recorded in the 1980s and 1990s with artists ranging from Patti Smith, Marshall Crenshaw, Loudon Wainwright III, and Suzzy Roche. His work can also be found on the new Willie Nile album, American Ride.\n\nMorsberger also played piano, accordion, organ, arranged strings and other odds and ends on Fairytale and Myth, Suzzy Roche and Lucy Wainwright Roche's ethereal and hauntingly beautiful new album. Suzzy Roche was devastated to learn of Morsberger's diagnosis and wanted to work with him again to make an album that would be a tribute to his beautiful musical gifts. &quot;In the face of his diagnosis, Rob threw himself into living and focusing on the true meaning of life, as well as making music. We made the record in the dead of winter huddled in the studio in our winter coats,&quot; says Roche, recalling the warmth and intimacy of the hours she and her daughter, Lucy, spent with Morsberger recording this album.\n\nThe songs on Fairytale and Myth range from a cover of McCartney and Lennon's &quot;For No One&quot; and Loudon Wainwright III's &quot;When I'm at Your House,&quot; a song that Suzzy, Lucy, and Loudon have been performing live for years, to a tale of the reality that pervades life through the cracks of a broken dream or an unrealistic take on the worldÃ¢â‚¬â€Mark Johnson's &quot;When a Heart Breaks&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€to the album's title track, Morsberger's transcendent tale of the power of love and our longing for it. Because of the transformative and evocative power of the harmonies of Suzzy and Lucy Wainwright Roche, and Morsberger's moving piano playing, this album poignantly captures the ragged ways that we all move between fantasy and reality.\n\n&quot;Fairytale and Myth&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€maybe the most beautiful song on an album full of beautiful songsÃ¢â‚¬â€opens with spare and mournful piano in a lullaby that, in part, retells the myth of Ariadne as a bedtime story about the longing all of us have for love. Although the song begins in the realm of fairytaleÃ¢â‚¬â€&quot;Once upon a time in days of fairytale and myth/there lived an ugly creature in a crooked labyrinth/all the priests and scientists gave the king advice/an angry god was calling for a human sacrifice/&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€it soon moves to the reality that underlies all of our long-held myths about loveÃ¢â‚¬â€&quot;everyone, everyone wants to be loved/our longing for love gets twisted and dark/you get lost in the maze that leads to your heart/you can't find your way back from the depths of your soul/'til the longing within you gets out of control.&quot; In the end, you &quot;close your eyes and go to sleep/don't be afraid to dream/the things that scare you half to death aren't always what they seem/say a prayer for anyone who needs some love tonight/give me one more kiss before I turn out the light.&quot; Our fairytales and myths about the nature of love can be scary and disturbing, but they also do show us that the love for which we ache requires sacrifice.\n\nThe album's final song, &quot;When a Heart Breaks Down&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€which has musical echoes of REO Speedwagon's &quot;Without Expression (Don't Be the Man)&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€opens with a jangling, jaunty piano that warms into a lilting ballad about the shortcomings of reason and passion when it comes to matters of love. &quot;The man of reason/sometimes he fails/to see the problems down inside him/he looks outside so all his feelings are denied/it's always lose instead of win with himÃ¢â‚¬Â¦the man of passion/sometimes he falls/into the arms of desolation/or else he feels he's on the train to paradise/while he's just sittin' in the station.&quot; Everybody's looking somewhere else when love is right there, close to her or him: &quot;when your heart breaks down /you can't do nothing/ the world is dark/ you need some loving/ somebody so kind/ someone who loves you/ return that love with a new found heart.&quot;\n\n&quot;I spent some of the warmest hours of my life making this album,&quot; Suzzy Roche says,&quot; and &quot;it was one of the most magical musical moments of my life.&quot; When you drop this CD on your player, the beauty and magic and power of Morsberger's piano and the Roches' sweet, exquisite harmonies will enchant and transport you. You'll mourn the loss of Morsberger, but you'll celebrate the life, love, passion, energy, and warmth of his music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f49350e18b9374bda96af4e35d8c8d2e87ad327","amp;dn":"Lucy+Wainwright+Roche+%26amp%3B+Suzzy+Roche+-+Fairytale+And+Myth+%5B20","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f49350e18b9374bda96af4e35d8c8d2e87ad327","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,73,53,14,24,185,55,75,218,150,175,78,53,216,200,210,232,122,211,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
