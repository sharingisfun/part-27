The trio goes to Eduard's summer house, surrounded by the majestic scenery of big forests and an empty beach. Mati, either out of jealousy or pride, has decided to win back his wife and will do anything his introverted and inert mind can come up with. What is love? Who can believe in such a thing? Is there anything at all to believe in? It can in its own minimalist way be a very funny experience and also a sad one to be dragged into this world. This film depicts with great accuracy how it is to feel love being an Estonian, someone who is used to low temperatures and repressed emotions. \n\n\nRip Specs:\n\nFile Name .........................................: Tuhirand (Veiko Ounpuu, 2006).avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 571,099,136 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 43:07.120\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 720x416 (AR: 1.731)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1351 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.180 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 2\n\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
