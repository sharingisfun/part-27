It describes how bragg discovered how to use X-rays to determine the arrangement of atoms in crystals and his pivotal role in developing this technique to the point that the structures of the most complex molecules known to man-the proteins and nucelic acids-could be solved. Although Bragg's Nobel Prize was for Physics, his research profoundly affected chemistry and the new field of molecular biology, of which he became a founding figure. This book explains how these revolutionary scientific events occurred while Bragg struggled to emerge from the shadow of his father, Sir William Bragg, and amidst a career-long rivalry with the brilliant American chemist, Linus Pauling.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:434abd521c01cc31b1998783cff3321e71916108","amp;dn":"Light+Is+a+Messenger+The+Life+and+Science+of+William+Lawrence+Br","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"434abd521c01cc31b1998783cff3321e71916108","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,74,189,82,28,1,204,49,177,153,135,131,207,243,50,30,113,145,97,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
