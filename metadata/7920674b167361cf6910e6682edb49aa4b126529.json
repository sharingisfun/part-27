YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve read the Brothers Grimm, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve watched the Disney cartoons, you cheered as these virtuous women lived happily ever after. But the lives of real princesses couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be more different. Sure, many were graceful and benevolent leadersÃ¢â‚¬â€but just as many were ruthless in their quest for power, and all of them had skeletons rattling in their royal closets. Princess Stephanie von Hohenlohe was a Nazi spy. Empress Elizabeth of the Austro-Hungarian empire slept wearing a mask of raw veal. Princess Olga of Kiev murdered thousands of men, and Princess Rani Lakshmibai waged war on the battlefield, charging into combat with her toddler son strapped to her back. Princesses Behaving Badly offers minibiographies of all these princesses and dozens more. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a fascinating read for history buffs, feminists, and anyone seeking a different kind of bedtime story.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7920674b167361cf6910e6682edb49aa4b126529","amp;dn":"Princesses+Behaving+Badly+-+Linda+Rodriguez+McRobbie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7920674b167361cf6910e6682edb49aa4b126529","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,32,103,75,22,115,97,207,105,16,230,104,46,219,73,170,75,18,101,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
