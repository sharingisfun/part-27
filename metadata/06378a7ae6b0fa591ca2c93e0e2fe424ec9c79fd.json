That is why the FonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ Budai ZenehÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡z set to work to provide the financial background and facilities necessary to do this comprehensive collection of Transylvanian village music.\nThe Final Hour project is supported by the Institute of Musiscology at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Starting in September 1997, there have been regular recording sessions with bands from Transylvanian villages who still play the local traditional music. Each band is at our disposal for five days during which time it is possible to make archival recordings of not only each bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s repertoire of melodies which serves the entertainment needs of more than one ethnic group, but also to document information regarding customs surrounding the traditional music and dance life. Singers and one or two couples of good dancers arrive to Budapest for these recording sessions with each band, helping to maintain the vocal and dance function of the instrumental music. Part of the program is devoted to documentation of the existing Transylvanian traditional flute music.\nThe CD archive resulting from work of the Final Hour program offers a vast amount of material on the musical traditions of Hungarians, Romanians, Gypsies, Saxons and Jews in Transylvania for research studies as well as a wealth of authentic material and background information for those involved in popular folk music movements. The complete collection will be available for scientific research in the archive of the Institute of Musicology of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.\nThe FonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ Records has started this series of CDs under the title ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNew PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡tria,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ presenting selections of the most representative material from the collection. This series is the spiritual descendant of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡triaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ series from the end of the 1930ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s by BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©la BartÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³k, ZoltÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n KodÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ly and LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡szlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ Lajtha in cooperation with the Hungarian Radio and the Museum of Ethnography.\n\nvol1:\nAladÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡r ZÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡gor, 1932-1997, Kalotaszeg. One of TransylvaniaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most famous and earliest studied historical-ethnographical regions lies west of KolozsvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡r (Cluj), surrounded by the Gyalu, VigyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡zÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ and MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©zes ranges. In this otherwise relatively uniform area of folk culture, villages which lie on the borders with the neighboring ethnographical regions of SzilÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡gysÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡g, MezÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬ËœsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©g, AranyosszÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©k, are communities that have their own characteristic features mixed in with the cultures of those respective areas. There are between 40 and 50 communities which ethnographical researchers consider as defining this area.\nRegarding the dances of Kalotaszeg, the first references are from the end of the 19th century. In earlier times there were musician dynasties existing in many villages, who not only took care of the musical needs of their own villages, but of the entire region as well. With the spread of popular music, interest in and need for traditional music in the villages of Kalotaszeg has decreased, thus in more recent years the number of Gypsy musicians has considerably decreased, or the musicians have retrained themselves to meet new musical needs. Playing on this recording is one of the last representatives of the old style Kalotaszeg string bands.\nThe traditional life in Kalotaszeg includes many dance events, some of which are centered around lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rites of passage, some around the yearly seasonal holidays. Of the Hungarian menÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dances, the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlegÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nyesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was the most widespread, whereas the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œverbunkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (the so-called menÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s recruiting dance) wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t so well known. The Kalotaszeg legÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nyes is the most archaic, most virtuose and most developed among the fast menÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dances in Transylvania. In the past, the dance cycle began with this dance, they danced it one at a time, often competitively, while the girls joined into a circle somewhere in the background and turned, doing what is called in Hungarian ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsiftelÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, while yelling out short verses in rhythm with the music called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcsujogatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The dance cycle continued with a couple dance in which they did a double ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ step and had variations of motifs which included an upbeat turn in a closed position, in turn with stamps, the woman turning under her own arm, both the man and the woman turning away from each other.\nThe faster music, known as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œszaporaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is danced similarly, though adjusting for the considerably quicker tempo. During either the slow or fast versions, the man may let go of his partner while he does solo figures which may include some of the legÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nyes figures. The music for the legÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nyes is very rich with respect to Transylvanian music, having more than thirty melodies. There are even more csÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s and szapora melodies due to the fact that in addition to old style melodies, new style Hungarian folk melodies and even 19th-century city csÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s music have been assimilated into this style.\nIn the breaks between dances, two important types of tunes are sung in a party situation: the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œkeservesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (lament) with completely unspecific rhythm, and the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhajnaliÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (dawn song) having slow rocking rhythm. There are also specific songs which belong to specific holidays such as the name day greetings and Christmas carols.\nThe Hungarian, Romanian and Gypsy music is in many ways very intertwined, while still having some specific characteristics. All three ethnic groups dance the csÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s and szapora, sometimes referring to the latter by a different name. Only the Romanians dance variations of the slow and quick ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œforgatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (a turnin dance) which is called invirtita rura si iute. Jews also lived in the area, who in addition to taking on the music of the Hungarians, in some places preserved their own melodic material as well. In their memory, the VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ralmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s band plays a tango, which was a part of the well known Jewish repertoire.\nThe material on this recording was recorded between October 6-10, 1997. Shortly after returning home, the prÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­mÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s, Pici AladÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡r, passed away. He was the last representative of the VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ralmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s musician dynasty. This recording serves as a reminder of his vast repertoire, more of which can be heard on the 15 archival CDs which were also recorded at that time as a part of the UtolsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“ra (Final Hour) Program.\n\nvol2: \nBudatelke (BudeÃƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸ti) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ SzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡szszentgyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rgy (SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ngeorzu Nou): Northeastern corner of the Transylvanian Plain (MezÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬ËœsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©g): SzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡szszentgyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rgy (in Romanian earlier called SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ngeorgiu sÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™sesc, now SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ngeorzu Nou, in German Sankt-GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rgen or Sankt Georgen) appears in the records since 1317. For centuries it belonged to Beszterce-NaszÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³d county which does not cover the same territory as the present day county. It is in the BesenyÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ district which in the 19th century was still ethnically Saxon. The first groups of the ethnic group which later became known as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSaxonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ were brought in from the middle Rhine area, Luxemburg and the Mosel area by the Hungarian king GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©za in the middle of the 12th century to the sparsely populated areas of the southern Transylvanian landowners. After the Mongol invasions King BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©la IV invited Saxons to beef up the depleted population. Under CeauÃƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸escuÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Communist regime, most of the Transylvanian Germans emigrated to Germany. Their music is preserved within the repertoire of village Gypsy musicians who had played for them, one of which is FerdinÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡nd Boldi of SzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡szszentgyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rgy. Budatelke (in Romanian earlier Budatelec, later BudeÃƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸ti) lies in the old Kolozs county, in the predominantly Romanian MezÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nyes district (the name of which refers to yet another ethnic group, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ny = Armenian).\nA large number of Gypsies live in the area and in earlier times smaller Jewish communities existed. Exactly this type of ethnically mixed area is always inviting for researchers: where dance and music is always in bllom as the various ethnic groups continuously fertilize one anotherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s culture.\nWith the disintegration of the traditional folk life, the dance traditions are also gradually sliding into the background throughout Transylvania. First the menÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dances are left out of the dance repertoire, the musicians, on the other hand, still preserve them for awhile as a part of their melodic repertoire. In this area a relatively large amount of this material has remained, in the dance as well, perhaps because in earlier times a particularly rich repertoire of menÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dances existed here. The two old style ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlegÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nyesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œritkaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â±rÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â± magyarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are both danced in the valley west of Budatelke by both the Hungarians and Romanians (the Romanians call it ungureÃƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸te rar Ãƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸i des). The ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œverbunkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (bÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™rbunc) and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢rnÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™veanaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are all danced by both ethnic groups. The verbunk is considered to be a new style of dance. The tÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢rnÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™veana, as its name suggests, is a relative of the Romanian ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œforgatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â®nvÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™rtita) from the region along the KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼kÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼llÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ River. According to earlier tradition, the menÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dances were danced one directly following the other, as on the sixth track of this recording.\nThe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlassÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âº csÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (a Hungarian slow couple dance) is part of the common Hungarian, Romanian, Gypsy dance repertoire, but only the Hungarians in eastern MezÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬ËœsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©g call it by this name. In western MezÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬ËœsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©g they call it ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlassÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âº cigÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡nytÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ncÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. In Romanian the same dance is called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â£igÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™neÃƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸te rar,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ while in the east it is also called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œleneÃƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸aÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The fast version of this dance is called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â±rÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â± csÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and in Romanian ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™rÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â£agÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™tutaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, while in the Gypsy language ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhutaÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½iÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The Gypsies dance both of these dances as couple dance though the couple does not touch each other; they call it ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcingerÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½iÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\nSome of the melodies on this recording are connected to the wedding repertoire. In every area the part of the wedding ritual of putting the brideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hair into a bun (kontyolÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s) is danced at the city weddings after the bride has changed clothes. At this time the guests at the wedding request a tune which is played for a few seconds while that guest dances with the bride: these short dances with the bride must be payed for. In this area, the very old custom in which the dance with the bride (jocul miresii) has specific tunes, has been preserved. There are unique instrumental melodies which are specifically connected to the wedding, to which the appropriate rhymed texts must be shouted (de chiuit la muntÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™), and they have also been preserved in this area. Included in this recording are Romanian songs in both flute and sung versions which arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t connected to any particular holiday or rite of passage. These may be played or sung anytime (LasÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™i pusca ruginitÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™). These non-specific metered songs are called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œkeservesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (laments) in Hungarian and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ntare, cÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ntec de jale, horiturÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in Romanian. Some of these songs were also sung when young men of a village were going into the army (track number 10).\nSome of the old funeral melodies have been preserved amongst the Gypsies. The band plays them during the wake and at the graveside (track number 5). Today they are played only here and there, by either Romanians or Hungarians (gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡zsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡lÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s), some variations with Hungarian words have turned up during various field work collections.\nThe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œprimÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (lead fiddler) from Budatelke knows the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œshepherd looking for his sheepÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ instrumental story, a genre which during a party or celebration is usually requested by shepherds. This type of tune exists in different districts with varied melodies. In a written form it was remembered by the Saxon consulate Andreas Frank who recalled this tune in the 17th century, on the celebrated occasion of GyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rgy RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡kÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³czi IIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s inductment on September 22, 1659 in MarosvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡sÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rhely. There was a previous reference to this particular genre in the 16th century in a verse by BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡lint Balassi.\nIn Transylvania the Seklers, the Saxons, like the Hungarians or the Germans all have their own national hymns, which in this case are specific to the identity of those ethnic groups. These are composed works, for which the music has been folklorized, given that both the Sekler and the Saxon hymns were often requested from the Gypsy musicians at the various events or holiday celebrations. During the Communist period it was prohibited to either sing or play them. Many musicians have told stories to researchers about the police harrasment which they suffered for playing these national hymns. On track number 11 of this CD the Saxon music is preserved by the hymn and lÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ndler music.\nGyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rgy Martin wrote: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe old style, rich and highly developed dance and music tradition of MezÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬ËœsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©g can be attributed to the combined effects of several things. Transylvanian renaissance and Baroque heritage have been preserved the most in this large area of central Transylvania. This in turn developed into a unique new Transylvanian dance and music style. The later new style of music and dance from Hungary and other foreign, aristocratic influences arrived here only later, and they were very selectively taken on. The intermingling of Hungarian, Romanian, Gypsy and Saxon cultures and their influences upon one another raised the Transylvanian dance and music treasury to the highest level. The result of the constant borrowing that went on was that the characteristic borders between the Romanian and Hungarian dances and dance melodies completely melted away, allowing a bilingualism of the music and dance to form in the MezÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬ËœsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©g.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½&quot;\n\nVol3:\nBÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© (BÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™rÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™i) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Magyarpalatka (Palatca). The MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡csingÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ Family: This recording of the Final Hour collection presents instrumental music from central MezÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬ËœsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©g, an area of Transylvania which, thanks to the work of ZoltÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n KallÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³s and GyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rgy Martin, is relatively well known and popular. The MezÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬ËœsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©g (meaning more or less ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œarea of fieldsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) in contrast to what its name implies, is an area of relatively high (4-500 m), at one time wooded hills which follow the course of short streams, lying between the Szamos, SajÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³, Aranyos, and Maros Rivers northeast of the Transylvanian city of KolozsvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡r (Cluj). It is a region of mixed ethnic population that was settled by Hungarians between the tenth and eleventh centuries, and has been depopulated many times by wars, making it necessary to bring in other groups of people such as Saxons, Swabians and Romanians. Nowadays Romanians make up the majority of the population, the Saxons and similarly the Jews have left Transylvania en masse due to events of the last fifty years.\nGypsies came to Transylvania in the sixteenth century, and by the beginning of the eighteenth century had almost entirely taken over the musical entertainment profession. The Gypsy musicians are generally Transylvanian Hungarian Gypsies, with names Hungarian or of Hungarian origin, who observe the predominant religion of the village where they live. Depending of the ethnic majority of the village, they speak either Hungarian or Romanian and they are likewise either Calvinist, Catholic, Evangelist or Orthodox. The musicians on this recording are originally from Magyarpalatka (Palatca) and are Calvinist, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHungarianÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Gypsies.\nThe instrument which carries the melody in a band from MezÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬ËœsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©g is the violin, while a specially tuned (g - dÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ - a), 3 stringed viola and a 2 or 3 stringed double bass provide the harmony and rhythm. In Palatka in the fifties and sixties it became common to have two violins and two violas playing; this is the formation playing on this recording as well. The violinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s playing style is very dynamic, richly ornamented, strongly rhythmic, and it controls the rhythm and tempo of the accompaniment. A Gypsy prÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­mÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s from MezÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬ËœsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©g learns and plays the melodies which are used in that area without discrimination, adjusting them according to his own preference, varying for example rhythm or tempo. For them there is no ideologic point of view when considering the origin of a melody. The name of a dance generally has no relationship to a melodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s origin. For example, in the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlassÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âº cigÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡nytÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ncÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (slow Gypsy dance) or in songs sung at Gypsy wakes no actual Gypsy melodies are heard. Or, Romanians, Hungarians, and Gypsies alike feel the same tunes accompanying boys into the army (called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œkatonakÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­sÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in Hungarian) like their own. Or, we hear obviously Hungarian melodies sung in Gypsy or in Romanian (or even in de-a lungu rhythm.)\nThe Gypsy prÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­mÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s in most cases does not know the text of the melodies. This is why they often ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ particularly with new style melodies with a dome-like structure ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ change the melodies, which results in a different structural basis: for example simply starting in the middle of a tune, causing the dome-like, arch-shaped structure to change to a descending one. The violas play the accompaniment, building major chords from the main notes of the melody, strenghtening it here and there with the dominant-tonic at the end of the phrase. The accompaniment style that is built upon the main notes with its mixtura, being more obvious in the melodies with slower tempo; just as the asymmetrical rhythm becomes more even and symmetrical as the tempo quickens. The songs in parlando, aside from their free accompaniment style, use basically two styles of bowing: called in Hungarian ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œduvaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â±vÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (wherein two quarter notes are produced by one stroke of the bow, with a marked stress on each of them) and the so-called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œesztÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡mÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (wherein staccato syncopated eighth notes are played). For dance tunes, the bass (called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgordunÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgordonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in Romanian) always plays on the main beat (on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). To the well intentioned Western ear, many times the notes donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t sound clean or like even the right note. Rhythmically speaking however, they are precise, given that this is the main function.\nOn this recording we present the music for many kinds of dances from this area. The ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHungarianÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ dances generally are called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œungureÃƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸teÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (meaning Hungarian in Romanian), and are requested from the musicians as such. At the various events where marches are played ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ escorting the bride, gathering the guest for a work party, bringing the wheat in from the fields following the harvest ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ melodies with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œszÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶kÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬ËœsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ rhythms are played, as in Palatka. When the procession stops from time to time, these can not only be danced to, but because of their tempo they are also perfect for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œrikÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³tozÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (rhythmic shouts). In the MezÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬ËœsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©g area, the dance and music traditions of the ethnic groups mentioned here, have become the most uniform in all Transylvania. The couple dances starting with the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œritka csÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (also called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcigÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡nytÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ncÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â£igÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™neÃƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸teÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) are common to all ethnic groups: the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œszÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶kÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬ËœsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (in Romanian, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™tutÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â±rÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â± csÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (haÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â£eganÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™) make up the dance cycle and are done by the Hungarians, Romanians and Gypsies alike. The Romanians replace the archaic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlassÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âº cigÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ny tÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ncÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â®mpiedicataÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) which the Hungarians do, with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œde-a lunguÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½; these are descendants of the old European processional type dances. According to our informants from these villages, some time ago the dance cycle consisted of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlassÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âº cigÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡nytÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡nc ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ritka csÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ szÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶kÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Ëœs (bÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™tutÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ progression of dances. It also seems archaic that to the music of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHungarianÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ dances, they danced de-a lungu in couples or that the men danced it separately.\nDuring the last decades, it has become the fashion to put the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢rnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢veanaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ at the end of the dance cycle; because it is similar in rhythm and tempo they also use its dance melodies for the foursome dance (nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©gyes), for example in MezÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬ËœkeszÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼. The two kinds of menÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s legÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nyes dances, the ritka and sÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â±rÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â± magyar are included amongst the so-called Hungarian dances, but the nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©gyes is also ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHungarianÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The asymmetrical Romanian menÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dances, the slow ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œromÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢neÃƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸te ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â®n botÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œponturiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œraraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are the Romanian versions of the Hungarian ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œritka magyarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, like the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™rbuncÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is the Romanian version of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â±rÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â± magyarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The Gypsies also dance the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™rbuncÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, their slapping sequences being for the most part similar to the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â±rÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â± csÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ though in a Gypsy version, used in the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcsingerdiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The cycle of couple dances in MezÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬ËœsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©g lasts 30-40 minutes, is generally danced from beginning to end with the same partner and has resting steps inserted. For the last cut on this recording, we have chosen a progression of music which is longer than usual, which nicely shows how the traditional intermezzo (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfloriceleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ meaning ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlittle flowersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) are used, and also works well for dancing at home or learning the dances. When this recording was made, there were good dancers present from the village of MezÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬ËœkeszÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼, thus the recording includes some songs from that village as well.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06378a7ae6b0fa591ca2c93e0e2fe424ec9c79fd","amp;dn":"Uj+Patria+vol+1%2C2%263+-+Village+music+from+transylvania","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06378a7ae6b0fa591ca2c93e0e2fe424ec9c79fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,55,138,122,230,176,250,89,28,162,201,62,14,47,228,36,236,156,121,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
