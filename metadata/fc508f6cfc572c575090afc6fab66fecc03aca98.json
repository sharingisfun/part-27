It includes VERY good performances by the band, footage of rehearsals with lots of fun and conversations and great imagery of Robert. You get to see great rare songs performed like The Big Hand. Amazing shows at the T&amp;C2 club in London, Great British Music Weekend at Wembley Arena, MTV Unplugged and The Brit Awards. Any Cure fan wants to have this so get it while you can.\n\nVideo info: XviD - 464x352 - 25fps - 2h 4mn 6s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc508f6cfc572c575090afc6fab66fecc03aca98","amp;dn":"The+Cure+-+Play+Out+%5B1991%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc508f6cfc572c575090afc6fab66fecc03aca98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,80,143,108,252,87,44,87,80,144,175,198,250,182,111,236,192,58,202,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
