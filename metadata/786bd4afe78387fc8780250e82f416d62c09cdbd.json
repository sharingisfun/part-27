With our 12th release, we are happy to celebrate one year of Crossfrontier Audio. After having an amazing 36-hour birthday party at Sisyphos in Berlin, with more than 25 artists on three floors, this compilation is part two of our little anniversary-celebration. The 12 new and exclusive tracks and remixes of past releases, once again show the musical diversity Crossfrontier Audio stood for in this last year. Thanks to Siopis, Nhar, David Durango, Durerstuben, Daniel Solar, Ignacy Rome, 9West, Andi de Luxe, Mass Digital, RiccardoRizza, F3, Max Farlane, Max von Valentiner and Los Cruzeiros for their great contribution. Finally, we want to say thank you to all the artists who were responsible for the great releases this year, to our graphic designer Stella Gelesh for the beautiful cover artworks, to our mastering engineer Matthew Sargeant who made sure every track had the best possible sound, and to all the DJs around the world who supported our music. Last but not least, we want to thank all the wonderful people who came to our label nights across Europe and made them unforgettable. We are really looking forward to this coming year, and have many exciting things to share with you. To give you a little sneak preview of the next months: an Argentinean special release, EPs by David Durango and Ignacy Rome, and of course our label parties in December at La Ruche in Lausanne and Ritter Butzke in Berlin.\n\nGet more promo house @ www.techconnet.com ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:786bd4afe78387fc8780250e82f416d62c09cdbd","amp;dn":"VA+-+One+Year+Crossfrontier+Audio+%5BCrossfrontier+Audio%5D+%5BCFA012%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"786bd4afe78387fc8780250e82f416d62c09cdbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,107,212,175,231,131,135,252,135,128,37,14,130,244,22,214,44,9,205,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
