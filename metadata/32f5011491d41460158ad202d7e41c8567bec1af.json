His theatrical, hiccup-styled, energetic, rockabilly vocal style inspired a later generation of rock vocalists, including Lux Interior of The Cramps.\n\n\nHe released his New Jungle Fever album in 1987 and Honkey Tonk Man in 1988, featuring the lead guitar work of his son, Bubba Feathers. These later albums of original songs penned by Feathers were released on the French label New Rose Records, whose other 1980s releases included albums by cult music heroes like Johnny Thunders, Alex Chilton, Roky Erickson, The Cramps, The Gun Club, and others.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32f5011491d41460158ad202d7e41c8567bec1af","amp;dn":"Charlie+Feathers+-+Honky+Tonk+Man+%26amp%3B+New+Jungle+Fever+%281987-8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32f5011491d41460158ad202d7e41c8567bec1af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,245,1,20,145,212,20,96,21,138,210,2,215,228,28,133,103,190,193,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
