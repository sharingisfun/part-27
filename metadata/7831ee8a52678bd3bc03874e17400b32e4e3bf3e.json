ÃƒÆ’Ã‹Å“rberg, is a Latin course written entirely in Latin.\n\nFAMILIA ROMANA - A Roman Family \n\nPart I, familia romana, covers the essentials of Latin grammar and a basic vocabulary of some 1500 words. The 35 chapters form a sequence of events in the life of a Roman family in the 2nd century a.d.  Each chapter is divided into 3 or 4 lessons (lectiones) and consists of several text pages followed by a grammar section, GramÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â­matica Latina, and three exercises, Pensa. At the end of the book there is a survey of inflections, a Roman calendar, and a word index, Index vocabulorum.\n\n \n\nThe CD-ROM containins the complete text of the book, an audio-recording of most of the chapters, and a full interactive edition of the exercises.\n\nAn entertaining narrative\n\nLINGVA LATINA provides a Latin text that students can read and understand immediately without any need for translation. In this text every sentence is intelligible per se because the meaning or function of all new words and forms is made clear by the context or by illustrations or marginal notes. This demands a carefully graded text, but to make learning efficient the content must stimulate interest and make it easy for the reader to visualize the scenes described. To meet these deÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â­mands the chapters of Part I form an eventful and entertaining narrative, which captivates students so that they look forward to reading the continuation of the story. The reading of this Latin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“novelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ also serves as an introduction to the life and culture of ancient Rome.\n\n \n\nDirect understanding\n\nThis direct method, based on understanding from the context, has proved efficient both for selftuition and class teaching. An important factor is the satisfaction experienced by students when they discover that they can actually read and understand Latin immediately without translating or decoding. Such direct understanding gives the students selfconfidence and stimulates concentration. It sharpens their faculties of observation and reasoning, faculties that will be greatly needed as the sentences grow more complex. Reading in this way, they move on step by step towards the ultimate object of Latin teaching: the reading of Latin literature in Latin with real understanding and appreciation.\n\nWebsite: http://www.lingua-latina.dk/index2.htm","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7831ee8a52678bd3bc03874e17400b32e4e3bf3e","amp;dn":"Lingua+Latina+per+se+illustrata+%28Orberg%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7831ee8a52678bd3bc03874e17400b32e4e3bf3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,49,238,138,82,103,139,211,188,3,135,78,23,64,11,50,228,227,191,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
