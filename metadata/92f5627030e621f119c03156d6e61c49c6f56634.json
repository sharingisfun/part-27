The inspired coinage was soon in\ngeneral use to describe killers such as necrophile Ed Kemper (ten victims),\nschizophrenic Herb Mullin (14), and homosexual mass murderers Dean\nCorll (27), and John Wayne Gacy (32). Then in 1980, in Colombia,\nPedro Lopez, the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Monster of the Andes,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ confessed to murdering 310\nprepubescent girls; three years later, a derelict named Henry Lee Lucas\nclaimed to have killed 350 victims. \n\nClearly, these sprees were on a scale beyond anything known in the history of crime ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ even the French ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Bluebeard,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Gilles de Rais, executed in 1440, was believed to have killed no more than 50 children. In more recent years, the American ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Pee WeeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Gaskins killed an estimated 110, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Red RipperÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Andrei Chikatilo 56, his fellow Russian Anatoly Onoprienko 52, and the British doctor\nHarold Shipman between 215 and 260. There was an obvious need for ResslerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new term to describe this horrific phenomenon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92f5627030e621f119c03156d6e61c49c6f56634","amp;dn":"Serial+Killer+Investigations+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92f5627030e621f119c03156d6e61c49c6f56634","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,245,98,112,48,230,33,241,25,192,49,86,214,230,28,73,198,245,102,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
