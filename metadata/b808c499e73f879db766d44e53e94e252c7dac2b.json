It is also genuinely important, because her prescription for curing the pathological silo-isation of business and government is refreshingly unorthodox and, in my view, convincing.â€ (Financial Times)\r\n\r\n&quot;In â€œThe Silo Effectâ€ she applies her anthropologistâ€™s lens to the problem of why so many organizations still suffer from a failure to communicate. Itâ€™s a profound idea, richly analyzed.&quot; (The Wall Street Journal)\r\n\r\n&quot;â€™Siloâ€™ has become a clichÃ© among management consultantsâ€”and executives trying to hang onto their jobs by speaking the language of the au courantâ€”but Tett gives the metaphor life in her engaging, case-study-filled new book.â€ (New York Post)\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\n\r\nGillian Tett oversees global coverage of the financial markets for the Financial Times, the worldâ€™s leading newspaper covering finance and business. In 2007 she was awarded the Wincott prize, the premier British award for financial journalism, and in 2008 was named British Business Journalist of the Year. Tett is the author of Saving the Sun: How Wall Street Mavericks Shook Up Japanâ€™s Financial World and Made Billions and The Silo Effect: Ordered Chaos, the Peril of Expertise, and the Power of Breaking Down Barriers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b808c499e73f879db766d44e53e94e252c7dac2b","amp;dn":"John-Batchelor-silo-effect-the-peril-of-expertise.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b808c499e73f879db766d44e53e94e252c7dac2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,8,196,153,231,63,135,157,183,102,212,78,83,233,78,37,44,125,172,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
