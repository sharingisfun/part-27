It provides a clear and comprehensive account of how this important diagnostic tool works. In addition this easy reference handbook provides guidance on the interpretation of images of common clinical conditions.\n\nThe book includes:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ An overview of the basic principles, explaining exactly how and why MRI works and how images are produced\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Easy-to-understand diagrams to explain the theory of MRI\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Safety procedures\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A Glossary of terms\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Over 100 annotated images of MRI scans to aid diagnosis\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ An additional atlas of normal anatomy for MRI interpretation\n\nWritten by two pioneering experts in the field with a combined experience of over 20,000 MRI studies of veterinary patients. Suitable for small animal veterinarians and veterinary students.\n\nIan Elliott trained as a Radiographer and first became involved with MRI in late 1980s. He has worked exclusively in MRI since 1991 and, following an extensive spell scanning human patients, helped pioneer the use of the technique in veterinary practice. Ian has been involved exclusively in veterinary MRI since 2000 and has scanned many thousands of cases during this time. He currently works for Burgess Diagnostics providing MRI services to veterinary surgeons throughout UK and Ireland.\n\nGeoff Skerritt is an RCVS Recognised Specialist in Veterinary Neurology, Diplomate of the European College of Veterinary Neurology and former President of the ECVN.
