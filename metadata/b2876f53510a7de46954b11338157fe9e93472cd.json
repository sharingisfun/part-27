I CAN'T UPLOAD NEW ALBUMS IF I'M THE ONLY ONE SEEDING MY PREVIOUS TORRENTS AS IT WILL TAKE MOST OF MY BANDWIDTH!!!\n\n\nTeeth - Time Machine (1997)\n\nGenre: Alternative\n\nOriginal Pilipino Music (OPM)\n\nComplete album. Encoded using Itunes at 320Kbps AAC.  Each track has the album artwork and proper ID3 tag. This is the best compressed format/bitrate for me right now. Use Itunes to play, or download an AAC plugin for your player or convert it to Mp3 if you want.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1\tKups\n2\tTake A Ride\n3\tTime Machine\n4\tBukas\n5\tLuha\n6\tBum Squad\n7\tTampo\n8\tHay Sarap\n9\tManhid\n10\tDogs Can Fly\n11\tPhone Rings\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2876f53510a7de46954b11338157fe9e93472cd","amp;dn":"Teeth+-+Time+Machine+%281997%29+%5BComplete%5D+%5BOPM%5D+%5B320Kbps+AAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2876f53510a7de46954b11338157fe9e93472cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,135,111,83,81,10,125,228,105,84,177,19,56,21,127,233,233,52,114,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
