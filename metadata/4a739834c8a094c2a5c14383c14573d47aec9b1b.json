Starting as a weekly in the mid-1920s, the magazine is now published 47 times per year, with five of these issues covering two-week spans. Although its reviews and events listings often focus on cultural life of New York City, The New Yorker has a wide audience outside of New York and USA. It is well known in its commentaries on popular culture and eccentric Americana; its attention to modern fiction by the inclusion of short stories and literary reviews; its rigorous fact checking and copyediting; its journalism on world politics and social issues; and its famous, single-panel cartoons sprinkled throughout each issue.\r\n\r\nThe New Yorker â€“ 8 February 2016\r\nEnglish | 112 pages | True PDF | 19.00 Mb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a739834c8a094c2a5c14383c14573d47aec9b1b","amp;dn":"The+New+Yorker+%26ndash%3B+8+February+2016%5BThePiratebay%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a739834c8a094c2a5c14383c14573d47aec9b1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,115,152,52,200,160,148,194,165,193,67,131,193,69,115,212,122,236,155,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
