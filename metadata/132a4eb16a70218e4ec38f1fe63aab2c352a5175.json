Ultimately, Goldsworthy realizes the full complexity of CaesarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s character and shows why his political and military leadership continues to resonate some two thousand years later.\n\n\n# Paperback: 608 pages\n# Publisher: Yale University Press (January 28, 2008)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0300126891\n# ISBN-13: 978-0300126891","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:132a4eb16a70218e4ec38f1fe63aab2c352a5175","amp;dn":"Caesar%3A+Life+of+a+Colossus+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"132a4eb16a70218e4ec38f1fe63aab2c352a5175","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,42,78,177,106,112,33,142,78,195,143,31,230,58,171,44,53,42,81,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
