Although this is certainly a modern production -- albeit one with keyboard sounds straight out of 1987 -- this isn't a record that feels contemporary, and Manilow doesn't reinterpret the songs so much as sing them his wayÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Âªwhich is all that he needs to do, of course, as that's all that his fans want. In other words, The Greatest Love Songs of All Time doesn't disappoint: it delivers what it promises, no more and no less.\n\nProduct Details\nRelease Date: 1/26/2010\nUPC: 886975977727\nLabel: Arista\nCatalog Number: 759777\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
