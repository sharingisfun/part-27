It was released on September 14, 2010 in the United States through Warner Bros. Records. The album was written by the band and co-produced by Linkin Park vocalist Mike Shinoda and Rick Rubin, who previously worked together to produce Minutes to Midnight (2007). The lead single for the album, &quot;The Catalyst&quot;, was sent to radio and released to digital music retailers on August 2, 2010. The band is currently promoting the album through the A Thousand Suns Tour.\n\nA Thousand Suns is a concept album dealing with nuclear warfare and themes of war in general. &quot;On this record, the concepts blend human ideas with technology [...] Human fears, your fear of what's going to happen in the world, the music kind of references that.&quot; (Mike Shinoda) The album's title comes from the Hindu Sanskrit text Bhagavad Gita: &quot;If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the mighty one,&quot; a quote made famous by J. Robert Oppenheimer in reference to the atomic bomb.\n\n\n*****Track listing*****\n\nAll songs written and composed by Linkin Park. \n\n1. \t&quot;The Requiem&quot;\n2. \t&quot;The Radiance&quot;\n3. \t&quot;Burning in the Skies&quot;\n4. \t&quot;Empty Spaces&quot;\n5. \t&quot;When They Come for Me&quot;\n6. \t&quot;Robot Boy&quot;\n7. \t&quot;Jornada del Muerto&quot;\n8. \t&quot;Waiting for the End&quot;\n9. \t&quot;Blackout&quot;\n10. \t&quot;Wretches and Kings&quot;\n11. \t&quot;Wisdom, Justice, and Love&quot;\n12. \t&quot;Iridescent&quot;\n13. \t&quot;Fallout&quot;\n14. \t&quot;The Catalyst&quot;\n15. \t&quot;The Messenger&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f6b88ab0a7223b21f75916e13cefccc54dbf720","amp;dn":"Linkin+Park+-+A+Thousand+Suns+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f6b88ab0a7223b21f75916e13cefccc54dbf720","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,107,136,171,10,114,35,178,31,117,145,110,19,206,252,204,84,219,247,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
