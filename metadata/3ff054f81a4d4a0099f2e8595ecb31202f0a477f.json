But 35 year old Kirati and 22 year old Nopporn know the story very well. Nopporn is a student at Rikyo University. His fatherÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s friend, Chaokoon Attikarnbady, is coming to Japan on a honeymoon with his new bride. The elderly Chaokoon requests that Nopporn serve as a tour guide for he and Kirati. Because of his age, Chaokoon is unable to keep up with the younger explorers, and bids them to go on without him. Nopporn has never known love, but soon he has fallen head over heels for the beautiful and enchanting Kirati. Nopporn professes his love, but Kirati will honor her marriage. Years go by, and Chaokoon reaches his end. When Nopporn and Kirati meet again, in Thailand, now 7 years later, will their unconventional love be given a second chance? \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ff054f81a4d4a0099f2e8595ecb31202f0a477f","amp;dn":"%5BThai+Movie%5D+-+Behind+the+Painting+-+2001+%2F+engl.subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ff054f81a4d4a0099f2e8595ecb31202f0a477f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,240,84,248,26,77,74,0,153,242,232,89,94,203,49,32,47,10,71,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
