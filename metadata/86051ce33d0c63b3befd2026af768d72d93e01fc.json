Dickinson, P. Walstra (Woodhead, 1993).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1 -85573-782-2\r\n\r\nThis overview describes new ideas and techniques for the study of structure and dynamics of direct relevance to food. It pays particular attention to the microstructure and rheology of concentrated systems containing deformable particles, emulsion droplets and gas bubbles, and describes factors affecting the composition, structure and dynamic properties of fluid interfaces, particularly the role of adsorbed polymers and surfactants in controlling stability. In addition, coverage of the application of new physical concepts to systems containing fat crystals and starch particles gives insight into the processing of food colloids","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86051ce33d0c63b3befd2026af768d72d93e01fc","amp;dn":"Food+Colloids+and+Polymers+-+Stability+and+Mechanical+Properties","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86051ce33d0c63b3befd2026af768d72d93e01fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,5,28,227,61,12,99,179,190,253,32,38,175,118,141,114,217,62,1,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
