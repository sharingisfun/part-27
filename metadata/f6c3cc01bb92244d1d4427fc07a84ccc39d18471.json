Eight of their albums have reached the Top 40 in the UK Albums Chart, and one of their singles, &quot;The King of Rock 'N' Roll&quot;, peaked at number seven in the UK Singles Chart.\nThe band formed in 1978 in Newcastle. Prefab Sprout have had minimal chart success in the United States. Their 1985 album Steve McQueen was released in the US as Two Wheels Good and peaked at number 180 in the Billboard 200. In spite of limited American success, frontman Paddy McAloon has been hailed as one of the greater songwriters of his era.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefab_Sprout&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefab_Sprout&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFrom Langley Park To Memphis - Prefab Sprout\nreleased 1988\n\n01  Prefab Sprout - From Langley Park To Memphis - The King Of Rock 'n' Roll\n02  Prefab Sprout - From Langley Park To Memphis - Cars And Girls\n03  Prefab Sprout - From Langley Park To Memphis - I Remember That\n04  Prefab Sprout - From Langley Park To Memphis - Enchanted\n05  Prefab Sprout - From Langley Park To Memphis - Nightingales\n06  Prefab Sprout - From Langley Park To Memphis - Hey Manhattan!\n07  Prefab Sprout - From Langley Park To Memphis - Knock On Wood\n08  Prefab Sprout - From Langley Park To Memphis - The Golden Calf\n09  Prefab Sprout - From Langley Park To Memphis - Nancy (Let Your Hair Down For Me)\n10  Prefab Sprout - From Langley Park To Memphis - The Venus Of The Soup Kitchen\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Langley_Park_to_Memphis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Langley_Park_to_Memphis&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6c3cc01bb92244d1d4427fc07a84ccc39d18471","amp;dn":"Prefab+Sprout+-+From+Langley+Park+To+Memphis+%281988%29++FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6c3cc01bb92244d1d4427fc07a84ccc39d18471","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,195,204,1,187,146,36,77,29,68,39,252,7,168,76,204,57,209,132,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
