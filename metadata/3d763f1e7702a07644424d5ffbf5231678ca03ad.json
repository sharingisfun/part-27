Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc. \n\n\nabout the author:\n\nCynthia Ozick (born April 17, 1928) is an American-Jewish short story writer, novelist, and essayist.\n\nOzick's fiction and essays are often about Jewish American life, but she also writes on a broad range of topics including politics, history, and literary criticism. In addition, she has written and translated poetry. The Holocaust and its aftermath is also a dominant theme. Much of her work explores the disparaged self, the reconstruction of identity after immigration, trauma and movement from one class to another.\n\nCritically acclaimed novelist and essayist David Foster Wallace called Ozick one of the greatest living American writers. She has been described as &quot;the Athena of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s literary pantheon,&quot; the &quot;Emily Dickinson of the Bronx,&quot; and &quot;one of the most accomplished and graceful literary stylists of her time.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d763f1e7702a07644424d5ffbf5231678ca03ad","amp;dn":"Cynthia+Ozick+-+3+books+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d763f1e7702a07644424d5ffbf5231678ca03ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,118,63,30,119,2,160,118,68,66,77,95,251,245,35,22,120,202,3,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
