Video is\n         on par with the average cam, and audio is a little\n         above average. The audio is a little bit quiet, so\n         turn up  your volume. Be aware that the film has a lot\n         of funky colors in it, so any unrealistic colors you\n         see, aren't just related to this rip.\n\n         There are a few minutes where the video goes\n         black throughout when the camera had to be hidden from\n         ushers. Also, unfortunately due to technical issues the\n         video from the last 15 minutes is not available. The\n         audio is still there, though. We'd suggest you either\n         listen the ending, or maybe even watch it theaters. We\n     would also be appreciative of any individual or group\n     who would go into the theater to CAM the last 15\n     minutes, and would be happy to do a rerender from our\n     master with the additional minutes added back in.\n\nScreens: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/89tHFEY.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/89tHFEY.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qvqzszY.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qvqzszY.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/YTs4lCy.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/YTs4lCy.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/uKmlMGc.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/uKmlMGc.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5ghQLc0.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5ghQLc0.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d4f70805588a5a5d8e7f73c92658ebf9f79a5ee","amp;dn":"Spring.Breakers.2013.CAM.READNFO.x264-AMiGOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d4f70805588a5a5d8e7f73c92658ebf9f79a5ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,79,112,128,85,136,165,165,216,231,247,60,146,101,142,191,159,121,165,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
