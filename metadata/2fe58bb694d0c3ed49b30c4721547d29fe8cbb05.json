The poetry sampler showcases six of forty-two verses that give readers an idea about how I view my life as a disabled and gay man.  TERWILLIGER'S TOMBSTONE TERROR is a nostalgic novella that deals with how a boy and his newfound friend thwart a pesky school bully.\n\n\nThe remaining two .PDF files are a call to action to share the files if what is read is liked and a listing of where all my other works can be purchased.\n\n\nI appreciate all downloads, likes and purchases.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fe58bb694d0c3ed49b30c4721547d29fe8cbb05","amp;dn":"I+Am+Destiny%27s+Child+and+Other+Poems+-Terwilliger%27s+Tombstone+Te","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fe58bb694d0c3ed49b30c4721547d29fe8cbb05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,229,139,182,148,208,195,237,73,179,12,71,33,84,125,41,254,140,187,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
