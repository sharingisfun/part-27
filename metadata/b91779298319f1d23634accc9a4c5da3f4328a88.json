Miller-Kovach outlines parents' responsibilities for ensuring a healthful diet for their kids: they must be food role models, food enforcers, activity providers and activity enforcers.\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b91779298319f1d23634accc9a4c5da3f4328a88","amp;dn":"Weight+Watchers+Family+Power%3A+5+Simple+Rules+for+a+Healthy-Weigh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b91779298319f1d23634accc9a4c5da3f4328a88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,23,121,41,131,25,241,210,54,52,172,204,154,76,93,163,244,50,138,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
