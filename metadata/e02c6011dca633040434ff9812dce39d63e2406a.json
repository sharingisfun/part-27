So here it is since it is no where on the internet.\n\nThis is a Explicit Lyrics version!!!\n\n\n \n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nZ-Trip's new project is an explosive combination of hip-hop and rock's finest and has more energy that a hydrogen bomb!! Z-Trip has built a name with his signature mash-up style and his record is sure to please fans across the board. Rakim and Chevelle collide in a single &quot;Let The Rhythm Hit Em 2007: and Dead Prez pair up with Deftones for an exclusive original track &quot;Locked and Loaded&quot;. Just as expected this record has a combination of big names featuring as well as heavyweights from the indie scene. With the music also featured in the new 2K Sports football video game &quot;Al Pro&quot;, retail can be assured the marketing will be major. A true burner from start to finish, this project is guaranteed to have people talking.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e02c6011dca633040434ff9812dce39d63e2406a","amp;dn":"%5C%22Z-Trip%5C%22+-+All+Pro+Soundtrack+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e02c6011dca633040434ff9812dce39d63e2406a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,44,96,17,220,166,51,4,4,52,255,152,18,220,227,157,99,226,64,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
