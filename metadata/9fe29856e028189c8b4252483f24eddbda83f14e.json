As exponents of '70s country-rock, the group rode a wave of success for five years on A&amp;M Records and survived in some form into the 1990s, with a following just large enough to justify occasional record releases in their later years. \n\n\nThe sextet was formed in Missouri during the early '70s, consisting of guitarists John Dillon and Steve Cash, blues harpist/singer/guitarist Randle Chowning, drummer/guitarist/singer Larry Lee, keyboard player Buddy Brayfield, and bassist-vocalist Michael Granda, and was signed to A&amp;M Records in 1973. Their first album, recorded under the supervision of producer Glyn Johns (who had also worked with the Eagles), was a critical success and yielded a Top 30 hit in &quot;If You Want to Get to Heaven.&quot; A year later, they had the biggest hit in their history, &quot;Jackie Blue,&quot; a mellow piece of country-rock that got to number three on the charts and still gets played occasionally as a '70s oldie. Their self-titled debut album set the tone for the group's next four releases, although by 1978's Don't Look Down, the sound was somewhat closer to country-pop than country-rock. \n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nThe Ozark Mountain Daredevils [Remaster] (2004)\n\nAudiochecker:\t\t100.00% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tBGO Records\nCatalogue:\t\tBGOCD648\nReleased:\t\t1973\n\n\n01.Country Girl\n02.Spaceship Orion\n03.If You Wanna Get To Heaven\n04.Chicken Train\n05.Colorado Song\n06.Standin' On The Rock\n07.Road To Glory\n08.Black Sky\n09.Within Without\n10.Beauty In The River\n\n\n\nIt'll Shine When It Shines [Remaster] (2003)\n\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.92% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tUniversal Music Special Markets\nCatalogue:\t\tB0001430-02\nReleased:\t\t1974\n\n\n01.You Made It Right\n02.Look Away\n03.Jackie Blue\n04.Kansas You Fooler\n05.It Couldn't Be Better\n06.E.E.
