Add a knife, gun, or multiple attackers to the situation and your dojo grappling techniques are likely to get you killed.\nTo survive and win a real world ground fight, you need a martial art designet to cope with the real world. You need Sambo - an explosive blend of striking, throwing and grappling methods specifically designed to fight and win against armed opponents, physically superior opponents, and multiple attackers. In this groundbreaking three-disc video series, Sambo expert Dr. Brett Jacques teaches you how to use this devastating art to defeat dozens of common street attacks. He also reveals the secrets of Sambo's dynamic groundfighting techniques, including escapes and reversals from the mount and guard positions, bone breaking submission and finishing holds, and never-before-seen information on grappling with armed opponents.\n\n(C) Paladin Press 1999\n\n01 - Introduction\n02 - Stances and zoning concepts\n03 - Control points and balance\n04 - Sambo kinesiology\n05 - Basic skills part 1\n06 - Basic skills part 2\n07 - Sambo self-defense\n08 - Sambo groundfighing\n09 - Grappling with weapons\n10 - Defenses from disadvanged position\n11 - Defenses against weapons\n12 - Multiple attackers\n13 - Conclusion","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d39bc18344213d95986b3a45ba6219717e78a9e","amp;dn":"Street+Sambo+by+Brett+Jacques+1999","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d39bc18344213d95986b3a45ba6219717e78a9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,57,188,24,52,66,19,217,89,134,179,164,91,166,33,151,23,231,138,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
