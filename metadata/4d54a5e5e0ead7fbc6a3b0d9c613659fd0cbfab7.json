In The Middle Of A Lonely Dream\n02. Heartbreak Angel\n03. I Feel Love\n04. Romeo And Juliet\n05. Every Little Kiss\n06. Fistful Of Dollars\n07. This Side Of Paradise\n08. Hurting\n09. Never Made In Heaven\n10. Heat Of The Night\n\nThis is the overall best Smokie album made by the line-up featuring ALAN BARTON on lead vocals in my opinion. In fact the man himself wrote what I consider to be the album's highpoint, the track Fistful Of Dollars.\n\nThe direction is probably more AOR than usual for the band and the last track Heat Of The Night has a riff borrowed directly from American rockers Starz. Ever heard So Young So Bad on Coliseum Rock?\n\nWhile probably the most difficult to obtain Smokie album, the strange title given apparently refers to the exotic choice of footwear worn by lead guitarist Alan Silson.\n\nTake a listen!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d54a5e5e0ead7fbc6a3b0d9c613659fd0cbfab7","amp;dn":"Smokie+-+Whose+Are+These+Boots+%5B1990%5D+CD+%40+320kbps+VBR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d54a5e5e0ead7fbc6a3b0d9c613659fd0cbfab7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,84,165,229,224,234,215,251,198,163,176,217,198,19,101,159,208,203,250,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
