Also if you use your PC to watch it, installing LAV Filter will help you a lot if you want to use KMPlayer or PotPlayer. However, MPC-HC (preferably in K-Lite Media Codec Pack) is the recommended. Many updated players have native support for the codec. To play on Android, use MX Player","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c7396386e59f82388606d25c680dd2ae3b1cad4","amp;dn":"TheTrainingofO+Trisha+Parks+720p+HEVC+x265","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c7396386e59f82388606d25c680dd2ae3b1cad4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,115,150,56,110,89,248,35,136,96,109,37,198,128,221,42,227,177,202,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
