When Bubbles&amp;#039; third grade teacher, Mrs. Anderson, catches the guys getting baked in the parking lot, she tells them it&amp;#039;s never too late to change their path in life. Bubbles feels guilty. Julian decides he needs to get a real job as he can&amp;#039;t survive off of the $18/day he&amp;#039;s making through meat sales and doesn&amp;#039;t want to work with Ricky anymore. Ricky&amp;#039;s got a problem: he can&amp;#039;t sell his dope. He&amp;#039;s got plenty of high-quality weed, and he knows it&amp;#039;s worth $12/gram, but no one&amp;#039;s buying - especially now that the dicks at the mall are undercutting him at $6/gram. Of course, it&amp;#039;s not as good - but it&amp;#039;s so cheap, no one cares. Even Lahey, who&amp;#039;s been reinstated to the police force and has given up liquor for dope, tells Ricky he&amp;#039;s got to drop his price. Meanwhile, Sara explains that Cory and Trevor are in a mental institution because they were on the verge of a nervous breakdown thanks to the fact that Ricky was treating them so badly.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2676df73aa1bcd312f71615e1be33432a1790321","amp;dn":"Trailer+Park+Boys+-+S07E01+-+%5C%22I+Fuckin%5C%27+Miss+Cory+and+Trev","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2676df73aa1bcd312f71615e1be33432a1790321","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,118,223,115,170,27,205,49,47,113,97,94,27,227,52,50,161,121,3,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
