He reflects on the profound effects of this rapid growth, both on humans and the environment.\n\nWhile much of the projected growth in human population is likely to come from the developing world, it is the lifestyle enjoyed by many in the West that has the most impact on the planet. Some experts claim that in the UK consumers use as much as two and a half times their fair share of Earth's resources.\n\nSir David examines whether it is the duty of individuals to commit not only to smaller families, but to change the way they live for the sake of humanity and planet Earth.\n\nAirtime: GMT 21:00\nAirdate: Wed 9 Dec 2009\nDuration: 0:58:12\nA/R (WxH): 1:1.78 (720x400)\nVCodec: XviD (2 pass MPEG)\nACodec: AC3 2ch 192Kbps\n\nFlawless encoding\nPls. help seed to keep torrent alive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:554c503074931e810deb34514a71067b60989e6c","amp;dn":"BBC+Horizon+-+How+many+people+can+live+on+planet+earth.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"554c503074931e810deb34514a71067b60989e6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,76,80,48,116,147,30,129,13,235,52,81,74,113,6,123,96,152,158,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
