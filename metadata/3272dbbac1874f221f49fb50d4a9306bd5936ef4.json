The band, also known by the names Bill Haley and The Comets and Bill Haley\\&amp;#039;s Comets (and variations thereof), \n\nwas one of the earliest groups of white musicians to bring rock and roll to the attention of white America and the rest \n\nof the world. Bandleader Bill Haley had previously been a country performer; after recording a country and western-styled \n\nversion of \\&quot;Rocket 88\\&quot;, a rhythm and blues song, he changed musical direction to a new sound which came to be called rock \n\nand roll.\n\nAlthough several members of the Comets became famous, Bill Haley remained the star. With his spit curl and the band\\&amp;#039;s \n\nmatching plaid dinner jackets and energetic stage behaviour, many fans consider them to be as revolutionary in their time \n\nas The Beatles or the Rolling Stones were in theirs.\n\nFollowing Haley\\&amp;#039;s death, no fewer than six different groups have existed under the Comets name, all claiming \n\n(with varying degrees of authority) to be the official continuation of the group led by Haley. As of early 2008, \n\nthree such groups are still actively performing in the United States and internationally.\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3272dbbac1874f221f49fb50d4a9306bd5936ef4","amp;dn":"BILL+HALEY+And+His+COMETS+-+Rock+Around+The+Clock+%5BFLAC%5D+%5BLIMAJD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3272dbbac1874f221f49fb50d4a9306bd5936ef4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,114,219,186,193,135,79,34,31,73,251,80,212,169,48,107,213,147,110,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
