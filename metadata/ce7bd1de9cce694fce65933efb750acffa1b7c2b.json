No one is entirely sure of the real figure.\n\nThe social fabric of Iraq, once held tightly together under the iron fist regime of Saddam Hussein, has now been torn asunder. Perhaps irrevocably.\n\nTwo million Iraqis have fled the country to seek refuge abroad. Another two million are displaced within Iraq.\n\nSectarian and ethnic divisions have exploded out of the Pandora&amp;#039;s Box which was Saddam&amp;#039;s Iraq.\n\nSunni and Shia Muslims have been killing each other. Kurds and Turcoman remain deeply hostile towards each other.\n\nDespite the promise of democracy which accompanied the US-led invasion, many observers say the lives of Iraqis are now considerably worse than before the invasion in 2003.\n\nInside Iraq this week examines the full costs of war to the people of Iraq and asks how Iraqis might be able to rebuild the shattered social fabric of the Iraqi nation amidst the ongoing turmoil.\n\nOur guests this week are:\n\nHady Amr, the director of the Brookings Institution in Doha, Qatar, Abdulhak Amer al-Nuemi of Qatar University, Kamel al-Adhadh, an economist, and Haifa Zangana, an Iraqi author based in London.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/9D83121F-FB25-47F4-BB3B-1C2ACA78950E.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/9D83121F-FB25-47F4-BB3B-1C2ACA78950E.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\ncap shunster ex- YouTube :\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce7bd1de9cce694fce65933efb750acffa1b7c2b","amp;dn":"Inside+Iraq%3A+The+Cost+of+War+%092008+03+28+%28Al-Jazeera%29+avi%09","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce7bd1de9cce694fce65933efb750acffa1b7c2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,123,209,222,156,206,105,79,206,101,147,62,251,117,10,207,250,27,124,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
