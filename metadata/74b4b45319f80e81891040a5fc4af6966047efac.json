Just a bad dream, he thinks. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s had them before. Yet he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help but worry when she cries out again as he pads down the hallway. Stepping through her doorway, he expects to find her sitting up in bed, frightened by a nightmare.\n\nBut the nightmare is his. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s real. And it's just beginning...\n\nSomething is burning Ash's daughter alive. Something horrible that is spreading beyond the walls of their home, and taking no prisoners.\n\nThirty seconds later, Ash will discover his daughter isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the only one in his family infected, and as his world spins, coming apart at the seams, a team of armed men in biohazard suits bursts into his house.\n\nBut these arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the good guys.\n\nThey havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come to save AshÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve come to separate them, to finish what they started.\n\nThe problem is Ash refuses to disappear. He wants only one thing: to find those responsible.\n\nBecause humanity is on the brink of execution.\n\nAnd man is pulling the trigger.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74b4b45319f80e81891040a5fc4af6966047efac","amp;dn":"Sick+%28A+Project+Eden+Thriller%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74b4b45319f80e81891040a5fc4af6966047efac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,180,180,83,25,248,14,129,137,16,64,165,252,74,246,150,96,71,239,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
