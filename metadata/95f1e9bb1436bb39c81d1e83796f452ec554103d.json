Each episode started off showing haunted &quot;hotspots&quot; on a map of the United States. A particular haunted location was then selected by each of the series' &quot;ghost hunters,&quot; and investigated by them and their team. Paranormal investigators, historians, psychics, and mediums all presented commentary on these sites. Historical footage was often shown, and any eyewitnesses interviewed. The show reported on the paranormal as told from purported personal encounters with the supernatural. At the beginning of each episode a parental advisory was shown: &quot;Warning: What you are about to see may be too extreme for the young, the impressionable, and the faint of heart. Parental discretion is advised.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95f1e9bb1436bb39c81d1e83796f452ec554103d","amp;dn":"Top+13+Most+Terrifying+Places+in+America-SDTV--x264-ZombiJunk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95f1e9bb1436bb39c81d1e83796f452ec554103d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,241,233,187,20,54,187,57,200,29,30,131,121,111,69,46,197,84,16,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
