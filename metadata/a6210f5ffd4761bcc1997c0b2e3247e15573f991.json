Thus, sibling singers Matt and Julia Lowe have Of Monsters and Men-type shouty harmonies; thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mumford-type rambunctious folk and StornowayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s joyous elemental pop. The big-drummed Contrails finds Julia hooting like an owl, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the latest band to have their photographs taken in a magical-looking forest. If there is a distinctive element, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the almost Europop synths and polished pop production. The haunting Sober detours from the default mode of nice and cheery, the darker subject matter suggested in the title. The brass-laden St Tropez and catchy title track both make good stabs at becoming hits, although they may not have enough to stand out in an overcrowded market\nRating 8.0/10\n\n\n01-Laws\n02-Win Again\n03-Won't Look Back\n04-Contrails\n05-Wildfire\n06-St Tropez\n07-Half Full\n08-Once Had\n09-Longer Than Gone\n10-Of Alarms\n11-Sober\n12-The Mad\n\n\nSummary:\nCountry:UK \nGenre:Indie-Folk \n\n\nMedia Report:\nSource : CD\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : ~720-917 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6210f5ffd4761bcc1997c0b2e3247e15573f991","amp;dn":"%282015%29+Keston+Cobblers+Club+-+Wildfire+%5BFLAC%2CTracks%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6210f5ffd4761bcc1997c0b2e3247e15573f991","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,33,15,95,253,71,97,188,193,153,124,11,46,50,71,225,85,115,249,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
