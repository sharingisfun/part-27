Squirrel\n \nSecret Squirrel is on the job, and needs to get a special spy gadget out. He keeps it where he keeps everything he needs, \ninside his trenchcoat. As he whips the coat open, the \n\nwoman he was trying to help screams and collapses. Secret looks at her oddly, saying &quot;Wait, I didn't even pull it out yet!&quot; \nBack at the office, Phil enters his office to find it has been burgled, plundered, and purloined ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ &quot;Ha-ha... loins.&quot; \nHe's missing a number of things only he can see, such as a \n\nbaby grand piano and a fourteen foot golden Buddha. When they are not returned even after he covers his eyepatch, \nhe sets up a color coded threat system and installs security \n\ncameras.\n\nBirdman tries to talk to the paranoid Phil, but he accuses him of supporting the thief, and of not working hard. \nHe tells Harvey he must get a big case by the end of the day, \n\nand Harvey tries, with limited success. Phil calls everyone in and bumps up the terror level to... BLACKWATCH PLAID!!!\n\nHarvey speaks with Secret, who explains his case to him. Phil finds a video of Bear moving about at high speeds \nand calls everyone in, believing he knows who the culprit is, \n\nand shows everyone a sketch of Bear crossed with Osama bin Laden. He raises the threat level to the maximum: \nthe cover of Rush's seminal album Moving Pictures.\n\nIn court, Harvey explains to everyone how Secret hides his spy equipment in his trenchcoat, although he has to \nendure Mentok saying &quot;I'll say&quot; to anything that could be \n\nconsidered a double entendre. Phil, however, has surveillance video that proves Secret actually was flashing \nthe woman, and is guilty.\n\nAt the end, the gang tries to figure out how to get their privacy back. Peanut's video of Phil playing Little \nBo Peep with a woman apparently fixes things.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe episode title is a reference to the tartan of the Black Watch regiment. \nMost of the animation used in this episode was re-used from earlier episodes, mostly &quot;Deadomutt 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;, \nas well as a few clips from &quot;Shaggy Busted&quot; and &quot;SPF&quot;. The only \n\noriginal scenes were of Phil trying to open his door and any live action footage. This was a trick older \ncartoons would sometimes use to cut animations costs, this episode \n\nbeing a clear parody of that. \n \nPlaintiff- N/A \nRepresentative- Myron Reducto \nDefendant- Secret Squirrel \nRepresentative- Harvey Birdman \nJudge- Mentok the Mind Taker \nDescription- Criminal trial; the defendant is charged with public indecency. \nDecision- The defendant is found guilty. \nQuotes- Episode 10 Dialogue Link \nCameos- Secret Squirrel, Boo Boo, Gloop \n\n --=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--\n\n11 Trio's Company Richard Ferguson-Hull April 18, 2004 625-012 \n---------------------------------------------------------------\nSummary Inch High v. Firm\n \nInch High P.I. is fired because all of his photos are poor quality due to their perspective being from an \ninch off the ground. He goes to Harvey for representation, but \n\nsomething's come up, and he's ignored for much of the episode. \nHarvey has joined a new spa, and a voluptuous red-head named Gigi works there, making out with every other \nguy in the place. He asks her out, and she suddenly moves into his \n\napartment, along with her friends Vince and Terry. Harvey's relationship with Gigi continues, but they \nnever as much as kiss, while she's found in compromising positions with \n\nevery other male in the office.\n\nInch High's case finally makes it to court. There, Mentok uses Reducto's shrink-ray to bring Inch High up \nto normal height. After having a carnie tell him (several times) that \n\nhe's tall enough for a ride, Inch High proceeds to show a tape of Gigi writing in her diary that she \nloves Harvey. The two embrace, and Mentok declares that he has no idea what \n\njust happened, and randomly gives the verdict of not guilty. The episode ends with a wedding between \nGigi, Harvey, Phil, Vince, Terry, Peanut, and the Bear.

Devlin\n \nA kid tries to imitate Ernie Devlin's deep ravine jump, and seriously injures himself. The family sues Devlin, \nand Harvey is called to defend him. Things don't look good after \n\nBirdman almost kills the kid trying to prove he can move. Freezoid's case doesn't help much either. \nAfter a discussion with Devlin, Harvey reveals that Devlin has pumped himself so full of pain killers from \nall his injuries that he had little to no common sense. He gives a \n\nplea of insanity, but Der Spuzmacher, a Tapir assassin that Devlin warned about earlier and Harvey disregarded \nas insane rambling, comes in and reveals that insanity pleas can \n\nonly be used in a criminal case. Birdman loses, but Devlin and Bobby come to an agreement. Bobby can ride \nDevlin's bike whenever he wants... and his woman.\n\nA side story that was removed left a few fragments. Avenger apparently lays an egg, and after a brief \ndiscussion between Harvey and Peanut about the whereabouts of the eagles \n\ngenitals, the two are interrupted by Devlin's entrance. Later in court Harvey is seen nursing an Egg \nwith an eagle hand puppet, and finally at the very end of the episode, it \n\nturns out the egg was the hidden lunch of Peter Potamus, who tried to take the egg back and is brutally \nattacked by Avenger. In an odd turn of events, the egg hatches to reveal \n\na half bird half Jesse Jackson.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe title of the episode is a reference to Flip Wilson's catch phrase &quot;The Devil made me do it!&quot; \n \nPlaintiff- Bobby \nRepresentative- Stan Freezoid \nDefendant- Ernie Devlin \nRepresentative- Harvey Birdman \nJudge Mentok- the Mindtaker \nDescription -The plaintiff claims the defendant is at fault for causing him to imitate his acts. \nDecision- The defendant is found liable for the plaintiff's injuries and is forced to allow the \nplaintiff to ride both his bike and his woman. \nQuotes- Episode 12 Dialogue Link \nCameos- Ernie Devlin, Hair Bear \n --=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--\n\n13 High Speed Buggy Chase Richard Ferguson-Hull May 2, 2004 625-013 \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nSummary People v.

Avenger returns to Birdman's side, opening a door and revealing \n\nthat Mark and Debbie, Speed Buggy's friends who have been making out through most of the episode, \nhave been sitting on Speed Buggy's remote control.

Twiddles\n \nAfter years of getting his powers from the sun, Harvey notices a mole that resembles Frida Kahlo on his face, \nand Peanut suggests he has it looked at. He goes to a doctor, who \n\nsuggests he wear SPF-710 sunblock and keep in the shade. This is a problem since Harvey gets his \nenergy from sunlight. He manages to get by without the sun by using &quot;Tanning \n\nCrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨me&quot; (a foreign branding joke) he gets from Peanut. The energy rush causes Harvey to quickly \nbecome addicted to the stuff, needing it just to stay awake, and that's when \n\nPeanut starts charging exhorbitant prices for it. \nHarvey goes to trial, representing Ding-a-Ling Wolf; Ding-a-Ling wanted to make a web site for all his fans, \nbut Harry Twiddles had already set up a porn site at the URL \n\nwww.dingaling.biz. Harvey brings before the court a number of others whose names had been hijacked for porn sites, \nincluding: Hi-riser, Big Duke &amp; Bigger Duke, Kwicky Koala, \n\nSchnooker, The Magic Rabbit, Fluid Man, Dirty Dawg, Mother Load, and Galtar... and his Golden Lance.\n\nAn intervention is staged for Harvey by all the others (who are indulging in addictive activities themselves, \nincluding smoking, gambling, and drinking). Harvey goes into \n\ncounseling, and is soon back to normal. Afterwards, the mole is found by Peanut to just be gravy. \nThe episode ends with a PSA by the cast of the show on skin cancer and \n\ncoconuts stuck in hippo mouths.\n\nNotes:\n\nThis was the first episode animated using Macromedia Flash. \nThe naked woman on the website's homepage was a compilation of classical nude paintings. \nHarvey's counselor is Jesse Jackson, as he appeared in the episode &quot;Very Personal Injury.&quot; \n \nPlaintiff- Ding-a-Ling Wolf \nRepresentative- Harvey Birdman \nDefendant- Harry Twiddles \nRepresentative- Myron Reducto \nJudge- Mentok the Mindtaker \nDescription- Cybersquatting; the Plaintiff claims the Defendant stole his name, using it for a porn site. \nDecision- Not shown. \nQuotes- Episode 14 Dialogue Link \nCameos- Ding-a-Ling Wolf, Scrappy-Doo, Hi-Riser, Big Duke, Bigger Duke, Mother Load, Schnooker, \nThe Magic Rabbit, Fluid Man, Kwicky Koala, Dirty Dawg, Galtar, Magilla Gorilla, \n\nMr. Twiddles \n --=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--\n\n15 Back to the Present Richard Ferguson-Hull May 16, 2004 625-014 \n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nSummary Jetson Family v. Earth\n \nIn the far off year of 2002, the Jetsons live in their luxurious, futuristic house high above the Earth's surface. \nTheir lives are suddenly turned upside down when the water \n\nlevel begins rising at an alarming rate. Global warming caused the ice caps to melt, and the Earth to become \nnothing but water. Suddenly, mutants begin breaking into the house, \n\nwhich is unable to get high enough to be out of the water's reach. \nFortunately, they manage to make it to the distant past (2004), specifically to Harvey's office. \nMuch to their dismay, they realize they have to walk to Harvey's desk from the \n\nentrance as there are no moving conveyer belts on the floor. The long journey takes them all night \nand they lose Astro to exhaustion (though he recovers) and Judy to a pack of \n\ndogs.\n\nThey tell Harvey that they want to sue everyone for screwing up the earth for them. The case goes to court, \nbut George has a problem with the jury. X sets up the Jury Vac, a \n\nrobotic jury that has the Apple startup sound when plugged in, and the trial is underway. Mentok clashes \nwith boy genius Elroy, who has a device from the future that tells him \n\npast events before Mentok does them. Freezoid uses his powers of cold on the warm August day to show \nhow global warming is preposterous. In the end, Jury Vac gives the \n\nverdict... on the O.J. Simpson trial.\n\nSomehow, the Jetsons lose the case, and return to their own time using the Delorean from the Back to the \nFuture movies, as rising water levels surround Harvey and the gang. \n\nEveryone has a hearty laugh.\n\n Plaintiff- George Jetson \nRepresentative- Harvey Birdman \nDefendant- People of Earth \nRepresentative- Stan Freezoid \nJudge- Mentok the Mindtaker \nDescription- The plaintiff claims the defendant has ruined the world for the people of the future. \nDecision- The defendant is found not guilty. \nQuotes- Episode 15 Dialogue Link \nCameos- George Jetson, Jane Jetson, Rosie The Robot, Mr. Spacely, Elroy Jetson, Judy Jetson, Astro, \nOrbity, Boo Boo, Jabberjaw.

Ape\n \nGrape Ape comes out to compete in the Laff-a-Lympics. He goes through his ribbon dancing routine flawlessly, \nbut when he takes a bow, all manner of pills, including steroids, \n\nfall from his uniform. \nHarvey walks into his office to find a giant urine sample waiting for him. Phil comes in with the \nLaff-a-Lympics committee, who begin to steal things from Harvey's office, \n\nsomething they continue to do through the whole episode. Phil hopes to get the Laff-a-Lympics to \ncome to their city. He has a big night planned with all of them and Gigi, his \n\n(and Harvey's... and everyone else's) shared wife. Gigi comes in, and she's pregnant. She claims \nHarvey is the father, though he doesn't recall their ever engaging in sexual \n\ncongress and they've only recently met.\n\nHarvey and Reducto have a nice chat about the whole situation, as well as the Grape Ape case that \nthey're both working on. Reducto sees the giant primate, and shrinks him down \n\nto fun-size. Grape Ape then grabs a weight and pumps it until he grows back to his normal size, \nwhich sends Reducto off screaming about how he's met the unshrinkable.\n\nThe courtroom has been splattered with ads. Gigi interrupts the case to leech off Harvey, but \nupon his return he speaks with a few unnaturally muscular witnesses who all claim \n\nGrape Ape had nothing to do with steroids. Reducto's witness describes the side-effects of steroids use, \nincluding withered testicles, which Reducto seizes upon since Grape Ape \n\nshould show reproductive organs the size of a nearby vendor's pushcart. An expert is about to reveal \nthe test results when he is hit by a dart in the neck by Harvey's new \n\nparalegal, son of a shaman/member of the Laff-a-Lympics committee.\n\nEleven of the jury members vote &quot;guilty&quot;, but the French member votes &quot;not guilty&quot;. Mentok \ndisregards this and convicts Grape Ape anyway. The doctor wakes up from the dart, and \n\nreveals that Grape Ape is the father of Gigi's baby. Also, the Laff-a-Lympics go to Dallas. \nGrape Ape and the others have to perform a court-ordered song about drugs as a \n\nsentence.\n\n Plaintiff- N/A \nRepresentative- Myron Reducto \nDefendant- Grape Ape \nRepresentative- Harvey Birdman \nJudge Mentok- the Mindtaker \nDescription- Criminal trial; the defendant is charged with steroid use. \nDecision- The defendant is found guilty and sentenced to community service. \nQuotes- Episode 16 Dialogue Link \nCameos- Grape Ape, Beegle Beagle, Yakky Doodle, Gleek, Gloop \n --=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--\n\n17 Peanut Puberty Richard Ferguson-Hull June 6, 2004 625-017 \n---------------------------------------------------------------\nSummary People v. Doggie\n \nDuring a board meeting of Sebben &amp; Sebben, Peanut's light shield starts growing uncontrollably, \nmuch to his embarrassment. He is going through &quot;superty&quot;, the period in which a \n\nyoung superhero acquires his superpowers, and resents Harvey's efforts to help him. \nMeanwhile, Augie Doggie comes to Harvey for help. They've put his father in a cage, claiming \nhe bit someone. The case goes to trial, and Mentok claims Doggie Daddy is baring \n\nhis teeth, and sentences him to undergo aggressiveness training. Phil trains him, treating him like \na normal dog and completely humiliating and torturing him.\n\nHarvey seeks advice from Apache Chief, Batman, and Reducto, but they don't help much. What finally \ndoes the trick is Peanut's conversation with Black Vulcan about his first \n\ntime (fighting a villain). In the background you can see Race Bannon and Dr. Quest playing baseball \nand football. Meanwhile, Harvey is speaking with villains about helping \n\nPeanut with his first time, and finally gets one to comply: X. In return all he wants is the Crest \non Birdman's helmet. Birdman agrees to the deal to help Peanut.\n\nPhil brings Doggie Daddy into the office, having completely broken him. Now, he is nothing but a \nmindless dog (although in later episodes, he is back to normal). X comes to \n\ncollect the Crest, and just as Harvey is about to give it to him, Peanut comes in with Metallo, \nhis new villain friend. X asks if he can still have the Crest... and Harvey \n\nproceeds to blast the bejeezus out of him.

A new regime of efficiency \n\nis sweeping Sebben &amp; Sebben, and one of its major parts is to keep only the top three earners. \nHarvey has to keep up with the new policy to keep his job, and watches as Phil \n\ndismantles his office. \nDvd fires Harvey's secretary Debbie, replacing her with a PDA the Supercalifragilisticexpiefficaceous. \nHarvey can't figure it out, but X, who's waiting outside to kill him, \n\nmanages to work it fine. He's sent off to search for Yakky Doodle. Meanwhile, the efficiency changes \nare getting worse. Visitors to the men's room can only use one sheet of \n\ntoilet paper, and Harvey's office has been sublet to a Greek restaurant, which Harvey must work at \nalong with his legal duties.\n\nX finally finds Yakky, who wants to change both his names.

Though the case seems open and shut, \n\nHarvey produces an indemnity waiver signed by Droopy and wins the case. The surgeon is overjoyed \nand gives Harvey a surgery coupon catalogue. Phil and everyone else around the \n\noffice give Harvey their highest praises but the gratitude is lost on him and he still feels guilty \nat Droopy's unfair loss and remaining predicament, especially after he sees \n\nthe dog crying and the image sticks with him. \nHarvey is promoted to vice president of Sebben &amp; Sebben and is given numerous executive privileges; \nhis coupons are doled out by Phil, whose recent LASIK has left him with a \n\nsecond eyepatch, blinding him.
