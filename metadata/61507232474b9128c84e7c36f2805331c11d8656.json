The couple's vocal harmonies often recall Steve Earle's work with Emmylou Harris, but the full-bodied production here, courtesy of Mark Howard, a Daniel Lanois protege, has more of the dreamy-yet-muscular mood of a U2 record. &quot;Won't Be Long,&quot; for example, features a dramatic, echo-laden chorus, and &quot;Sad Ole' Geronimo&quot; is fueled by blazingly distorted electric-guitar lines. While there is some pedal-steel twang present on the downbeat tracks &quot;Slow Dance,&quot; &quot;Love Will Guide You Home,&quot; and others, it's wrapped in such a gauzy veneer that it loses its country associations. Many of the songs on OUR ETERNAL GHOSTS sound like they floated away from Harris's Lanois-helmed WRECKING BALL sessions and found their way back to earth years later, making them welcome spirits indeed.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61507232474b9128c84e7c36f2805331c11d8656","amp;dn":"Deadman...Our+Eternal+Ghosts%282005%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61507232474b9128c84e7c36f2805331c11d8656","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,80,114,50,71,75,145,40,200,78,124,54,242,128,83,49,193,29,134,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
