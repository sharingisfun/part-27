There are hooks on the group's debut, Fresh Meat, but they are simple and repetitive, and the rhythm tracks lack complexity, while lead vocalist James Barnett's voice is almost annoyingly thin; the single &quot;House on Fire&quot; actually displays them at their worst instead of their best. A few cuts, such as &quot;Eat Me,&quot; suggest that the group has the capability of making bright, melodic dance-pop, but there aren't enough similar moments to make Fresh Meat worthwhile.
