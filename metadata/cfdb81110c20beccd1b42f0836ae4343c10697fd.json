I get the same comments as well as other artists in this Ã¢â‚¬Å“HorrorcoreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ genre like Ã¢â‚¬Å“You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really kill people, you arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really like thatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. My response is always the same, Ã¢â‚¬Å“neither does Stephen KingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nPumpkin Patch Girls: How long have you been rapping and what got you started?\n\nDieaboliK: I have been doing music for roughly 12 years now And to get to the status and placement that I am in with this genre is SO DOPE! IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve worked hard and stayed humble, I think that has really brought me a long way!\n\nPumpkin Patch Girls: What is your most preferred method of killing?\n\nDieaboliK: I think killing somebody mentally would be the most ideal. Sure, you can grab a shotgun and blow their chest out in less than a minute but where is the fun in that? Making somebody suffer for years seems to be more effective.\n\nPumpkin Patch Girls: With them being located primarily in Colorado and New Mexico and you being from Ohio, how did you meet the LSP crew?\n\nDieaboliK: I actually did a collaboration with Insane Poetry back in the day and stayed connected with him. That lead to finding out who the group Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dark HalfÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was. At that time Dark Half was starting up their own label called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jonestown RecordsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ I submitted a press-kit full of everything I have done over the years and they really was digging what they was finding in the kit. They decided on signing me to their label about a month or two later I found out Jonestown Records was falling through and the excitement was starting to die as fast as it came alive for me. I received a message from Dark Half stating that they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to leave me behind. Things came together and eventually I was brought unto the label Lyrikal Snuff Productionz which was more than the push I needed to shoot my career to another level! IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m very thankful for Dark Half, Insane Poetry and all the people behind the scenes at LSP!\n\nPumpkin Patch Girls: Your CD Ã¢â‚¬Å“Gator BoyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was released on December 14th 2013, Is this your first release with LSP?\n\nDieaboliK: Yes! Gator Boy was my first release on the label, it ended up doing pretty good. There was really no expectations to meet during the release but it is most definitely filled with my hardest work over the past year or 2. Shout out to everybody that helped in the making of this album! Scum, Insane Poetry, Dark Half, Playboy The Beast, Bloodshot, Ryit and Mars! IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m 100% proud of this album and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m starting to pump out videos from Gator Boy starting Spring 2014!\n\nPumpkin Patch Girls: What are the most common Ã¢â‚¬Å“search wordsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ you use when surfing porn? We recommend you try Ã¢â‚¬Å“pumpkinÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nDieaboliK: The most common words I use is Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hang TenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ because thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what surfers do right?\n\nPumpkin Patch Girls: Yes! What are your best and worst memories of being out on the road playing shows?\n\nDieaboliK: The best memory I have is the first time I performed in Denver Colorado with the LSP family. During my set, I turned around and noticed everybody that believed in what I can do for the team was standing on stage behind me. That let me know that these guys already have my back. The worst thing that has ever happened (He Laughs) That would be at Black X-mas Ã¢â‚¬â„¢14. Scum &amp; Insane Poetry brought me out on stage to perform our song Ã¢â‚¬Å“Try SuicideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and I was so fucked up from doing Jagerbombs with Playboy The Beast that about half way through the song I fell off the stage and about crushed and killed a 110lb female. Although quite embarrassing I spoke with her since then and she survived. I cant believe I did though, Shit!\n\nPumpkin Patch Girls: You just announced Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dead DazeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, your upcoming group with the incredibly sick and talented Smallz One, what can you tell us about the project?\n\nDieaboliK: Dead Daze, Dead Daze, Dead Daze. Where to even begin!? With all the stress in this music industry Smallz One and I decided to take it back to the reason why we fell in love with the horror music in general, in the first place! This album is coming together nicely. The most fun IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had in a long time with music and possibly the dopest music I have ever been a part of. Shout out to Smallz One!\n\nPumpkin Patch Girls: Can we expect a Dead Daze tour anytime soon?\n\nDieaboliK: I hope so! I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to tell you Ã¢â‚¬Å“Yes its going down!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and then it not happen but lets keep the fingers crossed. That would for sure be dope!\n\nPumpkin Patch Girls: Are you at all concerned that Smallz One will kill you, chop you up and sew you to parts of other bodies?\n\nDieaboliK: She actually already did that and I was like Ã¢â‚¬Å“foreal tho? youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re just gonna chop me up like your mad and shit!?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ She felt bad and was like Ã¢â‚¬Å“you know what, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sorry. I really didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean to do you like thatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Then she stitched me back together and made me a devil mask to wear so I can hide my stitches.\n\nPumpkin Patch Girls: ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s awesome. Who would you like to reach out to in the future for tours and collaborations?\n\nDieaboliK: I have a few in mind that I would like to collab with but I havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been focused on fuckinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ with other artists lately due to the fact that we are working on the Dead Daze album! As far as a tour, I think a tour with Smallz would be the best option.\n\nPumpkin Patch Girls: What would you say are your biggest influences when it comes to songwriting?\n\nDieaboliK: The biggest influence would have to be the old school horrorcore genre, the story-telling always grabbed my attention. Seeing other artists and labels grind to get where they want to be really makes me focus and write better. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve Got to keep up!\n\nPumpkin Patch Girls: ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s understandable. Ok, Imagine its the end of the world &amp; you are the only living man amongst the undead. Would you fuck a zombie?\n\nDieaboliK: I guess, its the same as fucking anybody else right? ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always that chance you could catch a Ã¢â‚¬Å“VirusÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. So yeah, I think I would bang a Zombie..\n\nPumpkin Patch Girls: While weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re on the subject, What is your favorite horror movie of all time?\n\nDieaboliK: Favorite horror movie of all time for me would be the original Evil Dead movie. The remake was good but I am a huge Bruce Campbell fan!\n\nPumpkin Patch Girls: What is the most diabolical thing youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever done or have been asked to do to someone in bed?\n\nDieaboliK: IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been told by this female to put a gun to her head and make her do everything I say. so, I was beating it up right? and she was like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ooooh yeah daddy give me more of that shitÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and I was likeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Ok, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m lying.\n\nPumpkin Patch Girls: Lilly Munster or Morticia Addams?\n\nDieaboliK: Are You kidding me? Lilly all day! Nah, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m more into Wednesday AddamsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ If she was of age, Is She??\n\nPumpkin Patch Girls: Yeah, every girl that have played Wednesday in the past are all over 18. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re from Ohio, Bengals or Browns?\n\nDieaboliK: Who Dey!\n\nPumpkin Patch Girls: What is the last album you bought a physical copy of?\n\nDieaboliK: Madchild Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lawnmower ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a Great Album!\n\nPumpkin Patch Girls: Is there anything else you want to say to the Faygoluvers readers? do you want to give any shout outs?\n\nDieaboliK: Thank you for supporting everything I do. Without you guys, I wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be shit! Shout out to everybody that fucks with my music. Shout out to Team Snuff! And a Shout out to you hating mother fuckers! Thank you Pumpkin Patch Girls!
