We got the full length undubbed master on FTD's release of 'Love Letters From Elvis' but here we get the full overdubbed master in great sound. Strangely it has Elvis vocals mixed out for the first 20 seconds or so, which are there on the unedited undubbed master, perhaps this is why the master is faded in five seconds after this point.\n\nWhat is listed as being the unedited overdubbed master of 'You Don't Have To Say You Love Me' is actually just a slightly different mix of the usual master with some additional notes played at the start.\n\nAs above, what is listed as being the unedited overdubbed master of 'Just Pretend' is actually just a slightly different mix of the usual master with the count-in and some additional notes played at the start.\n\nStill nice to hear how they started the song.\n\nWhat is listed as the brass &amp; strings overdubbed master of 'Faded Love' is actually just the usual master but with the count-in at the beginning, although the mix brings out the instruments more to the fore than say the mix on 'The Complete masters' set, but not as much as the prominent harmonica on FTD's Classic Album release of 'Elvis Country'.\n\n'The Next Step Is Love' (unedited overdubbed master) is actually a different mix to the usual master as the backing vocals are further back in the mix and the instruments are more prominent. We also get the count-in and take slate ('Eleven') along with the song running to the tape cut at the end of the song.\n\nWhat we get next is actually something special as it's the overdub of Take 3 of 'Make The World Go Away' that first appeared on the album 'Welcome To My World', but here it has the count-in and is a much clearer mix in sensational sound, along with Take 1 of the Work Part including overdubs. It's now clear how the overdubs progressed as the original master is Take 3 spliced with the ending of Work Part Take 1, and I never thought for one minute that they would have overdubbed both parts first and then spliced them together. We all learn something new every day.\n\nJust wonderful to hear this!\n\nWhat we get next is the unedited overdubbed master of 'I Washed My Hands In Muddy Water'. We got the complete unedited undubbed master, along with count-in and 'Oh Shit' ending on the bootleg 'A Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On' after first being released faded on 'Essential Elvis Volume 4' which took out the 'Oh Shit' part. Here we get everything complete, including overdubs. Another treat to hear!\n\n'Twenty Days and Twenty Nights' is a different mix (Channels seem to be reversed) to the 'Rough Mix master' used on FTD's 'That's The Way It Is' set and it also has the count-in at the beginning and goes right to the tape cut at the end where this was faded on the FTD.\n\n'I've Lost You' is the unedited overdubbed master first released on the DSD remastered release of 'Heart &amp; Soul', but here it contains some of the count-in and Felton Jarvis saying 'Un-RealÃ¢â‚¬Â¦' at the end.\n\nI always thought there was something not right about the intro to 'I Was Born About Ten Thousand Years Ago' and here it's revealed why. The tape didn't start rolling straight away when Elvis and the band were jamming and actually starts rolling mid-verse as you can hear on this release a line from the previous verse before the master as we know it. On here the song also runs on until the tape cut at the end and is not faded.\n\nWe first got the unedited master of 'The Sound Of Your Cry' on 'Greatest Hits Volume 1' and 'The UK release 'The Sound Of Your Cry' in the 1980's, but on here it runs for another 30 seconds or so longer than what we've had before and with a slightly different mix.\n\nNext we get the unedited undubbed master of 'The Fool' which first appeared on the bootleg 'Pure Diamonds Volume 4' from acetate source. Here it's presented with a few extra seconds in great sound from a tape source.\n\nThe unedited overdubbed master of 'Cindy, Cindy' is next and actually runs for another 45 seconds after the original master was faded. We got the full length undubbed master on FTD's Classic Album release of 'Love Letters From Elvis' but it's great to be able now to hear the full overdubbed master.\n\nTake 3 of 'It's Your Baby, You Rock It' is next that first appeared on FTD's 'Nashville Marathon' and again with a different mix and with additional dialogue at the start on FTD's Classic Album release of 'Love Letters From Elvis'. Here it is again with another different mix (Without the dialogue at the beginning) but has extra dialogue at the end including the slate count-in for Take 4.\n\nThe unedited overdubbed master of 'Stranger In The Crowd' is next, which was first released as the Rough Mix master on FTD's Classic Album 'That's The Way It Is', but here it seems to be a different mix with the count-in at the beginning. The sound on this song is simply stunning when compared to the same song on the FTD.\n\nThe unedited overdubbed master of 'Mary In The Morning' has the count-in before the song and runs to the tape cut at the end, where the original master was faded. The sound again in my opinion is stunning on this. I know I keep saying this about the sound quality but when you hear the difference to what has been released before you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.\n\nWhat is listed as 'This Is Our Dance' (Backup Vocal Overdub) is actually, and should be listed as, the undubbed master. It's exactly the same as what was released on FTD's Classic Album release of 'Love Letters From Elvis' with no apparent difference in sound quality either.\n\nNext we get 'Only Believe' with overdubbed horns which were eliminated from the original master, and now we can hear why - They sound terrible! It's still nice to get this missing link in the overdub process though.\n\nTake 9 (Alternate master) of 'Patch It Up' is next up, and we get a little bit more dialogue than was heard on FTD's Classic Album release 'That's The Way It Is', along with a different mix in superb sound.\n\nFinally we get a different mix of Take 1 of 'The Fool' but sadly it just cuts off at the end where Elvis says 'Let's do it one more time from the top'.\n\nAll in all another winner from the Venus label which I'm sure will be another favourite amongst fans. I know it is with me! If I may give you some advice: the first time you listen to it you should use good hardware (Sound System), relax and close your eyes. You'll love the sound and differences to what you know.\nThe only ones left i need by venus in flac\nunedited masters stax 1973\nChristmas today flac.\nNOT MP3 at all!!!!!!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55325aca1340c8e6859c7ee11c4e2caccb19a62a","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+Unedited+Masters+-+Nashville+1970","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55325aca1340c8e6859c7ee11c4e2caccb19a62a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,50,90,202,19,64,200,230,133,156,126,225,28,78,44,172,203,25,166,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
