Authors discuss in detail what are known commonly as â€œMore than Mooreâ€ (MtM), technologies, which add value to devices by incorporating functionalities that do not necessarily scale according to â€œMoore's Lawâ€. Coverage focuses on three key technologies needed for efficient power management and cost per performance: novel memories, 3D integration and photonic on-chip interconnect","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2d2464a482509a99923397f3d52c63241f2a27d","amp;dn":"More+than+Moore+Technologies+for+Next+Generation+Computer+Design","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2d2464a482509a99923397f3d52c63241f2a27d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,210,70,74,72,37,9,169,153,35,57,127,61,82,198,50,65,242,162,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
