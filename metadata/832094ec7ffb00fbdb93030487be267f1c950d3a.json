Their child is wonderfully clever, wonderfully well adjusted. Perfect in fact. Genetically modified in secret he and the other children born as a result of the programme, have a strange bond. They know they are different, they know they are better. None of the parents knew what the clinic was really doing. Unfortunately neither did the clinic. Mankind is about to be left in an evolutionary backwater. The children will move on, they don't need us. But a child needs its parents. Can the love between a parent and child survive the blind march of genes?\n \n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:832094ec7ffb00fbdb93030487be267f1c950d3a","amp;dn":"Perfect+People+-+Peter+James%2Cepub%2Cmobi%2C%2820011%29%2CKK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"832094ec7ffb00fbdb93030487be267f1c950d3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,32,148,236,127,251,0,251,219,147,3,4,135,190,38,127,28,149,13,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
