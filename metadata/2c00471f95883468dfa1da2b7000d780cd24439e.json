Arnold avoids glib pronouncements by letting the untidy experiences of ordinary people speak for themselves Ã¢â‚¬â€œ people who have earned the right to talk about overcoming hurt, and about the peace of mind they have found in doing so. &quot;Hurt&quot; is an understatement, actually, for these stories deal with the harrowing effects of violent crime, betrayal, abuse, bigotry, gang warfare, and genocide. But Why Forgive? examines life's more mundane battle scars as well: the wounds caused by backbiting, gossip, strained family ties, marriages gone cold and tensions in the workplace. As in life, not every story has a happy ending","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c00471f95883468dfa1da2b7000d780cd24439e","amp;dn":"Why+Forgive+Audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c00471f95883468dfa1da2b7000d780cd24439e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,0,71,31,149,136,52,104,223,161,218,43,112,0,215,128,205,36,67,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
