Part of what makes Angular so amazing is that it is a framework written from the ground up with testing in mind. In this course, we'll take a practical, hands-on approach to using Angular to its full testing capabilities.\n\nYou will learn how to build an app with good test coverage, how to write effective tests, and how to run tests automatically. Automated testing allows us to write code that is more reliable, more effective and easier to maintain.\nIn order to test Angular properly, you need to be familiar with a variety of libraries, many from the Angular team itself. This course will familiarize you with all the testing frameworks you'll need: Mocha, Chai, Protractor, Karma and more.\nBy the end of this video series, you will be able to integrate into a workplace team using Angular test-driven development, and use testing in your own projects to maximize your effectiveness","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c702cecef7a86f16c80f14fe746a6f8f08dae86e","amp;dn":"TutsPlus+-+AngularJS+for+Test-Driven+Development","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c702cecef7a86f16c80f14fe746a6f8f08dae86e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,2,206,206,247,168,111,22,200,15,20,254,116,106,111,143,8,218,232,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
