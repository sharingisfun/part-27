This CD will be of interest to more serious Led Zeppelin fans as it brings JPJ and Page together for the first time, and the team-up of blues legend Albert Lee with Jimmy is indicated for the faithful. More casual fans can give it a pass, there's very little on display here by Mr. Page that indicates the &quot;Shapes Of Things&quot; to come, but it gives props to Mr. Page's blues chops. Those looking to hear clearer precursors to Led Zeppelin are directed to the Yardbirds &quot;Where The Action Is&quot; and/or &quot;Live Yardbirds! Featuring Jimmy Page&quot; instead. \n\n\n\n\nLabel: The Store For Music Ltd. \nRelease date: June 14, 2011\nGenre: Classic Rock / Blues-Rock\nFormat: FLAC image+.cue\nBitrate: lossless\nTracks: 14\nDuration: 00:44:38\nCovers: Included\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1b19608a6c4bfa36dd34e32e58ba6fcbb1d6838","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Page+-+Playin%5C%27+Up+A+Storm+%282011%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1b19608a6c4bfa36dd34e32e58ba6fcbb1d6838","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,177,150,8,166,196,191,163,109,211,78,50,229,139,166,252,187,29,104,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
