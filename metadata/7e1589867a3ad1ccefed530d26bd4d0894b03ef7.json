Having had some of the world's most successful chefs in his kitchens Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including Gordon Ramsay and Australia's own Shannon Bennett and Curtis Stone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ White will challenge, inspire and mentor the 18 professionals. By his side, ensuring that no element of the dish goes unnoticed, will be MasterChef AustraliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perennial favourite, esteemed food critic Matt Preston.\n\nBe prepared to meet some of the country's most innovative and exciting chefs, competing to win a career-defining, money-can't buy experience.\n\nFor these qualified chefs, food is their world, their passion, their love.
