Thankfully, the authenticity that appeared in patches throughout his last record, The Sun Is Always Brighter, steers his latest. \nThe closest he comes to radio pop is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMagazine,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which is musically light but lyrically heavy. In fact, all his lyrics are weighty: James fills songs with images of burning boats and burning letters, blood on the floor, deep incisions and cancer. He delivers in a raspy voice that sounds wounded at all the right times (like on the tragic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLawn Full Of MarigoldsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ when he sings, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTo my ma IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve failed you / To my pa I blamed you / And to God I have shamed you againÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). \n\nThough the sound is bigger than a folk record, the dark lyrics are wrapped in familiar Americana. The instrumentation is meticulousÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½nothing sounds out-of-place, especially the aching pedal steel, which is used with remarkable restraint. Build Me This is convincing from its opening lineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI ainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t cutting my hair till the good lord comesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½through its solemn last words: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve given up.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b8d86cfe57bc30ea5f8d429ae48a44a4aa282fd","amp;dn":"Joshua+James+-+Build+Me+This","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b8d86cfe57bc30ea5f8d429ae48a44a4aa282fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,141,134,207,229,123,195,14,165,248,212,41,174,72,164,74,74,162,130,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
