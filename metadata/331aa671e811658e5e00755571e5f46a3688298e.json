So you only have to remember one single master password or insert the key-disk to unlock the whole database. The databases are encrypted using the best and most secure encryption algorithms currently known (AES and Twofish).\n\nToday you need to remember many passwords. You need a password for the Windows network logon, your e-mail account, your homepage's FTP password, online passwords (like website member account), etc. etc. etc. The list is endless. Also, you should use different passwords for each account. Because if you use only one password everywhere and someone gets this password you have a problem... A serious problem. The thief would have access to your e-mail account, homepage, etc. Unimaginable.\n\nFeatures of KeePass Password Safe:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Highly encrypted databases\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Support of master passwords and key-disks\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Runs on all Windows operating systems and doesn't need to be installed\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Export password list to TXT, HTML, XML or CSV files\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Import from CSV, CodeWallet(Pro) TXT and Password Safe v2 TXT files\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Easy database transfer\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Support of password groups\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Time fields and entry attachment support\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Auto-type, global auto-type hot key combination and drag-n-drop support\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Intuitive and secure Windows clipboard handling\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Searching and sorting\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Multi-language support\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Strong random password generator\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Low memory requirement\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Plugin architecture\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Open-Source!\n\nSeed and share!!\n\nClick on my username for 2011 softs!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:331aa671e811658e5e00755571e5f46a3688298e","amp;dn":"KeePass+Password+Safe+2.14+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"331aa671e811658e5e00755571e5f46a3688298e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,26,166,113,232,17,101,142,94,0,117,85,113,229,244,106,54,136,41,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
