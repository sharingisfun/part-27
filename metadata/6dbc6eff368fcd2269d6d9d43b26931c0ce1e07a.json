Feist - Magician Apprentice 1-12 (complete)\n[IMG]http://img170.imageshack.us/img170/8416/9b53c794f96959a4medsh9.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[quote]Pug and Tomas are two kitchen boys who dream of being heroes one day in the medieval fantasy world of Midkemia. But as the boys start on the path to manhood and begin their apprenticeships to their respective masters, they one day stumble upon a strange shipwreck and learn that invaders from a strange and distant world have found a way to invade Midkemia through portals known as &quot;rifts&quot; and are preparing for a full scale assault. As Tomas learns to be a soldier and Pug studies the path of a magician, both boys find themselves growing into the heroes they had hoped to become - but growing apart as the effects of the Riftwar change both of their lives forever.\n\nWritten by New York Times bestselling author Raymond E. Feist, MAGICIAN is the first story of his epic Riftwar saga, a series that has often been compared to THE LORD OF THE RINGS for its depth in storytelling and in characters. For over 20 years, MAGICIAN has been one of the foremost novels in the realm of fantasy, and now it is brought to life by fan favorite artist Brett Booth (THUNDERCATS: DOGS OF WAR, THE BURNING MAN) with a faithful script by Michael Avon Oeming (POWERS, RED SONJA) and Bryan J.L. Glass (NEGATIVE BURN).[/quote]\n\nThanks to all the scanners involved.\n\nIF YOU LIKE THE BOOK, THEN BUY THE COMICS OR THE TRADES.
