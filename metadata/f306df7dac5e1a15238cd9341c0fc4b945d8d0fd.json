It emphasizes recurring themes in all statistical algorithms, including computation, assessment and verification, iteration, intuition, randomness, repetition and parallelization, and scalability. Unique in scope, the book reviews the upcoming challenge of scaling many of the established techniques to very large data sets and delves into systematic verification by demonstrating how to derive general classes of worst case inputs and emphasizing the importance of testing over a large number of different inputs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f306df7dac5e1a15238cd9341c0fc4b945d8d0fd","amp;dn":"Foundations+of+Statistical+Algorithms","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f306df7dac5e1a15238cd9341c0fc4b945d8d0fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,6,223,125,172,94,26,21,35,140,217,52,28,15,196,185,69,216,208,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
