Their song Mindbender charted in the top 100 singles in 1978. The band existed from 1973 to 1982 and was based in Warner Robins, Georgia. They released two albums on Capricorn Records, Stillwater (1977), which included the single &quot;Mindbender&quot;, and I Reserve The Right! (1979). They opened for such bands as the Atlanta Rhythm Section and the Charlie Daniels Band. They broke up shortly after the loss of Capricorn Records. \nThe original tapes has been misplaced. Until they are found, enjoy this vinyl rip.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e1095dd536711934d674dc9c42c1a6fead03919","amp;dn":"Stillwater+Compilation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e1095dd536711934d674dc9c42c1a6fead03919","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,16,149,221,83,103,17,147,77,103,77,201,196,44,26,111,234,208,57,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
