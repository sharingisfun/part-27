Do What You Like (15:20)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBlind Faith's first and last album, more than 40 years old and counting, remains one of the jewels of the Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, and Ginger Baker catalogs, despite the crash-and-burn history of the band itself, which scarcely lasted six months. As much a follow-up to Traffic's self-titled second album as it is to Cream's final output, it merges the soulful blues of the former with the heavy riffing and outsized song lengths of the latter for a very compelling sound unique to this band. Not all of it works -- between the virtuoso electric blues of &quot;Had to Cry Today,&quot; the acoustic-textured &quot;Can't Find My Way Home,&quot; the soaring &quot;Presence of the Lord&quot; (Eric Clapton's one contribution here as a songwriter, and the first great song he ever authored) and &quot;Sea of Joy,&quot; the band doesn't do much with the Buddy Holly song &quot;Well All Right&quot;; and Ginger Baker's &quot;Do What You Like&quot; was a little weak to take up 15 minutes of space on an LP that might have been better used for a shorter drum solo and more songs. Unfortunately, the group was never that together as a band and evidently had just the 42 minutes of new music here ready to tour behind. ~ Review by Bruce Eder\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ef34193d4b4384b9db64585265028594e6577a5","amp;dn":"Blind+Faith+-+Blind+Faith+%28Japan+Platinum+SHM-CD+%282013%29+FLAC+Beo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ef34193d4b4384b9db64585265028594e6577a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,243,65,147,212,180,56,75,157,182,69,133,38,80,40,89,78,101,119,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
