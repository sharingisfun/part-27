Or when even accessing the world wide web was something only readily available in a library? Back then letters still filled up postboxes and moments just felt so much more precious when captured on Polaroid film. Now life seems to move at the speed of light. Our memories are captured and shared with the world on social media platforms. And love, which is already capricious, can feel like it is moving at terminal velocity.\n\nIn Makoto ShinkaiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s defining work, the internationally renowned director and animator unfolds a love story that is as timeless as it is fleeting. Yukiko SeikeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rendition of this modern classic adds a new level of emotion and intimacy that is unique to its source material.\n\nInfo Source: MyAnimeList\nDownload Source: Manga Traders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:170a62d843938597473bac5c831aa00b483e4570","amp;dn":"Byousoku+5+Centimeter+-+Vol.+01+%26amp%3B+02","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"170a62d843938597473bac5c831aa00b483e4570","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,10,98,216,67,147,133,151,71,59,172,92,131,26,160,11,72,62,69,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
