As of June 2013, they have released five studio albums, two EPs, and four live albums. The best way I can describe their sound is a mix between rock, acoustic, folk, reggae, funk, and hip/hop. Although just about every song they have ever released is great, they are most well-known for [i]The General[/i].\n\nThese are the original [i]All Points Bulletin[/i] concert CDs (ripped at 320kbps bitrate) and DVD (untouched). If you want to burn the DVD to a disc, you will either need a DVD-DL, or you'll need to use a program like DVD Shrink to compress video and remove unwanted titles/tracks.\n\n[b]PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE:[/b] If you like these CDs and DVD, consider buying them and/or other Dispatch albums/DVDs. Remember, they are an indie band, and they really rely on their fans to keep them going. They originally got big through people\nsharing their music on Napster, and they have acknowledged that. In the early days of P2P filesharing, they took a stance in support of it. They give so much back to their fans and to various charities. If you like their music, please give a little back to them.\n\nFor more information about Dispatch and their charity work, please check out:\n\n[url]http://Dispatchmusic.com[/url]\n[url]http://Amplifyingeducation.org[/url]\n\nShamelessly copied from Wikipedia:\n\nAll Points Bulletin is a 2004 live album by American indie/roots folk band Dispatch. Much like their previous live album Gut the Van, the album was released onto two discs. The first is entitled &quot;Somerville&quot; and captures the band's intimate &quot;warm-up&quot; gig prior to their free performance to approximately 110,000 fans on the second disc, entitled &quot;Hatch Shell.&quot; The purchase of the double album also includes a DVD recording of both performances.\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written by Dispatch, except &quot;Out Loud&quot;, which contains a portion of Bob Marley's and Peter Tosh's &quot;Stir It Up&quot;. \n\nAll songs recorded live in concert, 2004.\n\n[b]Disc 1: Somerville[/b]\n\n&quot;Open Up&quot;\n&quot;Time Served&quot;\n&quot;Here We Go&quot;\n&quot;Cover This&quot;\n&quot;Riddle&quot;\n&quot;Bang Bang&quot;\n&quot;Ride a Tear&quot;\n&quot;Lightning&quot;\n&quot;Mayday&quot;\n&quot;Even&quot;\n&quot;Passerby&quot;\n&quot;Prince of Spades&quot;\n\n[b]Disc 2: Hatch Shell[/b]\n\n&quot;Past the Falls&quot;\n&quot;Bullet Holes&quot;\n&quot;Fallin'&quot;\n&quot;Two Coins&quot;\n&quot;Bridges&quot;\n&quot;Elias&quot;\n&quot;Carry You&quot;\n&quot;Bats in the Belfry&quot;\n&quot;Out Loud&quot;\n&quot;The General&quot;\n\n[b]DVD:[/b]\n\n[b]Live at Somerville Theater (July 28, 2004)[/b]\n\n&quot;Open Up&quot;\n&quot;Time Served&quot;\n&quot;Here We Go&quot; @\n&quot;Bang Bang&quot;\n&quot;Ride a Tear (Pete Francis)&quot; @\n&quot;Mayday&quot; $\n&quot;Even&quot;\n'Mission&quot;\n\n[b]Live at the Hatch Shell (July 31, 2004)[/b]\n\n&quot;Past The Falls&quot; $\n&quot;Two Coins&quot; ~\n&quot;Passerby&quot; +\n&quot;Riddle (State Radio)&quot;\n&quot;Fallin' (Braddigan)&quot;$ ^\n&quot;Bridges&quot; +\n&quot;Prince of Spades&quot; +\n&quot;Headlights&quot;\n&quot;Elias&quot;\n&quot;Carry You&quot; + ~\n&quot;Bats in the Belfry&quot;\n&quot;Outloud&quot;\n&quot;The General&quot;\n&quot;Ending Credits - Dem Shoes&quot;\n\n@Feat Craig Dreyer [Saxophone]\n$Feat Brian Sayers [Drums]\n+Feat Phil Keaggy [Guitar]\n^Feat Reinaldo de Jesus [Percussion]\n~Feat Paul Tillotson [Keyboards]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6ac1782ddb1ffb5168ce13e649b82285502de4f","amp;dn":"Dispatch+-+All+Points+Bulletin+%28CDs+%26amp%3B+DVD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6ac1782ddb1ffb5168ce13e649b82285502de4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,172,23,130,221,177,255,181,22,140,225,62,100,155,130,40,85,2,222,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
