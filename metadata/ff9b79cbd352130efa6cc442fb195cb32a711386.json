But if you're still want to download it, then I won't stop you. I'm just a description after all.\n\n-----\nShutshimi is for Windows, Mac and Linux PCs, written in C# using XNA (Windows) and Monogame (Mac, Linux)\nAn XBLIG version is also available, but it's not this one.\n\nShutshimi is a randomized shoot'em up about a muscle-bound fish with memory problems defending the seven seas from the terrors of the deep!\n \n \n= FAST SHOOT EM UP GAMEPLAY =\n \nLevels are set up in 10 second waves as Fishy's memory only extends that far!\n \n \n= JUST AS FAST SHOPPING SIMULATION =\n \nfollowing that you have 10 seconds to pick an item in the SHOP TIME. Be careful with what you pick though, some items in the shop have negative effects. Due to Fishy's poor memory what items look like don't always relate to their abilities, so READ THE DESCRIPTIONS CAREFULLY!\n \n= THERE'S BOSSES TOO =\n\nFinish them fast or they'll escape your clutches! If you can last that long, mwahahah!\n\nWe are Neon Deity Games based out of both the US &amp; Canada and our website is http://www.neondeity.com .
