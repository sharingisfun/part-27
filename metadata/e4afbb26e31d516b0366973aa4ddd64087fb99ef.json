Alchemists discovered this rule many centuries ago. We take it for granted that chemical reactions take place in solutions, but hold this fact at the back of our minds or even completely forget about it. As chemists well know, 199 reactions out of 200 can only take place in solution.\nThe title of this book promises to take up some extraordinary properties of solutions. Some readers may disagree with the choice of the word. They may argue, for example, that there is nothing extraordinary in the fact that salt solutions can conduct electricity or that a solution would freeze at a lower temperature than a pure solvent. Science has explanations for everything, they may add. One sagacious man has once said that science begins by seeing unusual in the usual. That is why every book on science is always an invitation to see unusual in the usual.\n\nCONTENTS\nOn Dry Lemonade and About This Book 6\nWhat is a Solution? 9\nMidway Between Gases and Crystalline Solids 10\nWater - Puzzling and Extraordinary 18\nFrom the Physicist's Point of View 32\nThose Dissociating into Ions 49\nAcids and Bases-is This Simple as That? gQ\nIons in Solutions 69\nFlow of Current Through a Solution 77\nSolubility 90\n&quot;Not in Water Alone&quot; 93\nIs There Life Outside Earth? 97","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4afbb26e31d516b0366973aa4ddd64087fb99ef","amp;dn":"The+Extraordinary+Properties+of+Ordinary+Solutions+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4afbb26e31d516b0366973aa4ddd64087fb99ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,175,187,38,227,29,81,107,3,102,151,58,164,221,214,64,135,251,153,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
