As it happened, both Gooding and Dylan were native Minnesotans. Gooding had first met Dylan in Minneapolis in late 1959, not long after he graduated from high school.\n\nAs the interview gets rolling, the 20-year-old Dylan wastes little time before launching into some tall tales about his past. He says he moved to Minneapolis from South Dakota, because Minneapolis was Ã¢â‚¬Å“about the only place you didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to go too far to find the Mississippi River.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Before that, he says, he traveled with a carnival, Ã¢â‚¬Å“off and on for about six years.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ When Gooding asks whether that might have interfered with his schooling, Dylan doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t miss a beat. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Well,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he says, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I skipped a bunch of things, and I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go to school a bunch of years and I skipped this and that.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ He says he wrote a song for the Ã¢â‚¬Å“elephant ladyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the carnival and called it Ã¢â‚¬Å“WonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t You Buy A Postcard?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ But he quickly adds that he forgot how it went.\n\nIf you listen to the complete one-hour program you will be treated to 11 songs from his early repertoire.  They include several that Dylan wrote, along with some old folk and blues songs:\n\n    Ã¢â‚¬Å“(I Heard That) Lonesome WhistleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Hank Williams/Jimmie Davis)\n    Ã¢â‚¬Å“FixinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to DieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Bukka White)\n    Ã¢â‚¬Å“Smokestack LighningÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (HowlinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Wolf)\n    Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hard TravelinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Woody Guthrie)\n    Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Death of Emmett TillÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½  (Bob Dylan)\n    Ã¢â‚¬Å“Standing on the HighwayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Bob Dylan)\n    Ã¢â‚¬Å“Roll on JohnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Rufus Crisp)\n    Ã¢â‚¬Å“StealinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (traditional)\n    Ã¢â‚¬Å“It Makes a Long Time Man Feel BadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (traditional)\n    Ã¢â‚¬Å“Baby, Please DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t GoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Big Joe Williams)\n    Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hard Times in New York TownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Bob Dylan)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6493ff882fbe17ed3013365996a9401a1803e056","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Folksinger%27s+Choice+-+Interview+and+Songs+-+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6493ff882fbe17ed3013365996a9401a1803e056","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,147,255,136,47,190,23,237,48,19,54,89,150,169,64,26,24,3,224,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
