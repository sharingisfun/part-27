Using incredibly powerful computer servers spread around the world, Google wants to become the primary depository of all things digital about you - your e-mail messages, your documents, your music, your movies, your television shows, your favourite web sites, your financial transactions, perhaps in the future even your medical history will reside in Google's cloud. In return, you will be able to access everything, everywhere and at any time.\n\nHow and why Google is approaching this daunting endeavour is the focus of the behind-the-scenes documentary. Filmed in Google offices in China, Russia and at the Googleplex, its Silicon Valley headquarters, the documentary reveals a corporate philosophy and attitude unique among major companies today. Beyond its &quot;Don't be evil&quot; motto, Google has set as its goal &quot;to organize all the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful&quot; and to do it in the next 300 years. As Google CEO, Eric Schmidt says in the documentary, &quot;Successful companies start with very audacious goals.&quot; If Google achieves its goals, it will not just be successful; it may very well become the most powerful company in the world.\n\nGoogle World is produced by Ted Remerowski for Centillion Productions Ltd. in association with CBC.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 349 MiB for 44mn 4s 878ms\n\nSource            : HDTV\nCodec             : XviD\nLanguage          : English CA\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Documentary\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 959 Kbps\nAspect            : 624 x 336 (1.857) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 134 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1901acd60f6b06d0f2eebe80ee36607c54a479e7","amp;dn":"CBC.DOC+ZONE.Google+World+%282010%29.HDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1901acd60f6b06d0f2eebe80ee36607c54a479e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,1,172,214,15,107,6,208,242,238,190,128,238,54,96,124,84,164,121,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
