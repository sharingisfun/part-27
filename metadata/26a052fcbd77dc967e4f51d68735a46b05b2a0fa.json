Early Angelina Jolie, looking stunningly beautiful, strikes the right balance of loopiness and reality. Anne Archer startles with an effervescent comic turn that will surprise her fans and delight the unfamiliar. Danny Aiello is the perfect everyman, at times innocently confident followed by sheer bafflement at the insane goings on around him. And Alfred Molina, is brilliant as Aiello\\\\\\&amp;#039;s long suffering out-of-work actor sidekick who finds the perfect role in a real life drama. Independent film at its best. Don\\\\\\&amp;#039;t miss it!
