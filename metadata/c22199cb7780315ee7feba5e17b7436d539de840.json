Since their formation in 1994, the group has had two name changes, being previously known as Sleep of Right and Ethereal. Inspired by the combination of gothic imagery and music, the members have been known, musically, for composing mid-tempo songs consisting of prominent guitar lines and contrasting dual female/male vocal harmonies to help create a melodic, detached sound. Much of the band's recent material, however, sees a heavier and more down-tuned style, featuring a more distinct bass line and a higher mixing of the guitars within the songs. The band's 2012 release, Dark Adrenaline, peaked at number 15 on the Billboard 200. They have toured internationally and were nominated for a MTV Music Award.\r\n\r\nOn December 8, 2015, it was announced that the band are recording a new album, titled Delirium, which is scheduled for a 2016 release.\r\n\r\nOn January 14, 2016, Lacuna Coil announced the amicable departure of longtime guitarist Marco Biazzi.\r\n\r\nOn April 8, 2016, Lacuna Coil premiered the song &quot;The House of Shame&quot; along with announcing the release of the album to be May 27, 2016.\r\n\r\nOn April 11, 2016, Cristina Scabbia and Andrea Ferro during the Italian press tour presented Diego Cavallotti as the new live guitarist for the forthcoming tour.\r\n\r\nOn April 23 2016 &quot;Not Life Again&quot; EP appeared on torrent sites\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n\r\n01.
