This rebroadcast is one of many I have recorded from internet radio. Some are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\nIn this broadcast:\n\nThe first and probably the only time four acts appear in a row in the countdown all from Sydney, Australia\n\nA listener wants to know, &quot;In the rock era, what song has spent the most weeks at number one?&quot; With ten weeks being the record, it is a three-way tie between a Cuban bandleader, Pat Boone's daughter, and lovely &quot;Livy&quot; from down under. Casey plays parts of all three songs.\n\nThere is a song in the countdown that features a lead oboe. Casey tells which one.\n\nA listener wants to know, &quot;What the first heavy metal band to make the top ten?&quot; Casey says this band took their name from a song that was later remade by Donny and Marie Osmond in 1976.\n\n&quot;Always On My Mind&quot; by the Pet Shop Boys (at number 17) is a disco version of a country song. Casey remembers (and plays parts of) other disco remakes, including a disco version of &quot;Stairway To Heaven.&quot;\n\n40: Tall Cool One - Robert Plant\n39: I'm Still Searching - Glass Tiger\n38: Lost In You - Rod Stewart\n37: Pink Cadillac - Natalie Cole\n36: When We Kiss - Bardeux\n35: Da' Butt - E.U.\n34: Angel - Aerosmith\n33: My Girl - Suave\n32: Wishing Well - Terence Trent Darby\n31: Under The Milky Way - The Church\n30: New Sensation - Inxs\n29: Beds Are Burning - Midnight Oil\n28: Electric Blue - Icehouse\n27: Pour Some Sugar On Me - Def Leppard\n26: Mercedes Boy - Pebbles\n25: Dreaming - Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark\n24: Strange But True - Times Two\n23: Nothin' But A Good Time - Poison\n22: Nite And Day - Al B.
