This is in order to make the path (drive, directory and filename) as short as possible. Operating systems have limits regarding how long a path including the filename can be, and if this limit is exceeded there will be errors.\n\n----------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c691f11e61cc1f6e94364fa0e5fc7f722bcf636","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Smith+Trio+with+Lou+Donaldson+%281957%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c691f11e61cc1f6e94364fa0e5fc7f722bcf636","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,105,31,17,230,28,193,246,233,67,100,250,14,95,199,247,34,188,246,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
