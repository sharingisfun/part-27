These four powerful beings have been increasingly at odds with human kind, and Neryn must prove her worth to them. She desperately needs their help to use her gift without compromising herself or the cause of overthrowing the evil King Keldec.\n\nNeryn must journey with the tough and steadfast Tali, who looks on Neryn's love for the double agent Flint as a needless vulnerability. And perhaps it is. What Flint learns from the king will change the battlefield entirelyÃ¢â‚¬â€but in whose favor, no one knows. \n\n\nPlease seed and rate the torrents I upload. Go to kobobooks.com and choose books that you want uploaded and request them in the comments.\nNote: Comics on that site are in some weird ass format that only works on iOS and Android. To get those I have to go through the tired process of screen shots of each page, then create a word file, then convert to epub. Its a pain because even then the images may not show up right on some devices/apps.\n\nSupport Amas school of technology. The only school of its kind in an entire 3rd world country that doesn't force poor people to pay.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33eb40678e4cb4cba826d5f580d5a08d132fd355","amp;dn":"Raven+Flight","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33eb40678e4cb4cba826d5f580d5a08d132fd355","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,235,64,103,142,76,180,203,168,38,213,245,128,213,160,141,19,47,211,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
