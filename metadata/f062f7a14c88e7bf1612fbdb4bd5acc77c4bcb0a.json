Here, Sokal teams up with Jean Bricmont to expose the abuse of scientific concepts in the writings of today's most fashionable postmodern thinkers. From Jacques Lacan and Julia Kristeva to Luce Irigaray and Jean Baudrillard, the authors document the errors made by some postmodernists using science to bolster their arguments and theories. Witty and closely reasoned, Fashionable Nonsense dispels the notion that scientific theories are mere &quot;narratives&quot; or social constructions, and explored the abilities and the limits of science to describe the conditions of existence","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f062f7a14c88e7bf1612fbdb4bd5acc77c4bcb0a","amp;dn":"Fashionable+Nonsense_+Postmoder+-+Alan+Sokal.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f062f7a14c88e7bf1612fbdb4bd5acc77c4bcb0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,98,247,161,76,136,231,191,22,18,251,219,75,213,172,199,124,75,203,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
