Cameron Diaz stars as Christina Walters, a jaded, club-hopping single woman in San Francisco who has given up trying to find the perfect mate to focus on &quot;Mr. Right Now.&quot; Her equally cynical friend, Courtney (Christina Applegate), a divorce attorney, shares much the same attitude, while their pal, Jane (Selma Blair), is more starry-eyed and naÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ve. Christina's attitude gets an unexpected makeover one evening at a nightclub when she meets Peter Donahue (Thomas Jane), a real estate agent she finds adorable and just about perfect. Unfortunately, Peter leaves and all Christina knows about him is that his brother, Roger (Jason Bateman), is getting married soon in their small hometown. Recognizing her friend's romantic distress, Courtney suggests they road trip to the wedding and Christina agrees, leading to encounters with a series of obstacles, including some funky leftovers, a filthy service station restroom, and a rather unpleasant revelation once the women arrive at the nuptials.
