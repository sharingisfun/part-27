Martin are one and one only storyline that was divided in two parts due to the size and the speed of Martin's writing. \n\nA Feast for Crows (book 4) covers only the south and west of Westeros. While A Dance with Dragons covers the East of Essos and the North of Westeros. \n\nThis geographical divide creates a burden on the readership that is really disturbing. And... let's face it, what happens in the South and West is not at all as interestting as what happens in the North and East (at least not when read alone). \n\nBut now, that the two books are finally published, it's possible to read the two storylines finally combined, with the minimum hassle and preserving the surprises and other things that shouldn't be spoiled. \n\n(For more details on the reading order, read this blogpost (Spoiler Free) : &lt;a href=&quot; http://boiledleather.com/post/25902554148/a-new-reader-friendly-combined-reading-order-for-a&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://boiledleather.com/post/25902554148/a-new-reader-friendly-combined-reading-order-for-a&lt;/a&gt; it's the main source of inspiration for this ebook) \n\nThat's exactly what this ebook is doing, simply putting the chapters from AFFC and ADWD together in the best fucking possible reading order ! \n\nAnd damn, it's good.\n\nEnjoy !\n\nInfo :\nLanguage : English\nFormat : Epub (Best readers : Calibre and Adobe Digital Editions) \nMaps not included.\nYou'll need to convert this to MOBI to read on the Kindle or on a Tablet/Phone that doesn't read Epub (If you convert with Calibre (the best tool for it) do not forget to ask the converter NOT to add sections breaks after page breaks or page breaks after line feeds.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd957040fced17b2ad88adcf789ab8ca7e3c9c36","amp;dn":"A+Song+of+Ice+and+Fire+4%26amp%3B5+-+A+Feast+For+Dragons+%28AFFC%26amp%3BA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd957040fced17b2ad88adcf789ab8ca7e3c9c36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,149,112,64,252,237,23,178,173,136,173,207,120,154,184,202,126,60,156,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
