She becomes victim of her classmate Sarala's jealousy and trickery and complains about Murali to Principal. The event results in hatred between them and Murali losing scholarship. Murali gets help from his uncle Lingaiah and goes to London for higher studies. Lingaiah in return plans to give his daughter Lakshmi to Murali upon his return. Lingaiah appoints Anuradha as care taker of innocent Lakshmi. Anuradha comes to know about their plan and sacrifices her love for her cousin Lakshmi. Lakshmi has different plans; She is in love with her brother in law Yoganandam and not interested in Murali. She asks Anuradha to write replies to Murali's letters on her behalf. Anuradha goes through lot of struggle in the process.\n\nMurali loses his eyes in a lab accident. Lingaiah loses interest in alliance. Anuradha pretends as Lakshmi and nurses Muarli, while he is blind. She prepares for his operation with the help of their common friend Sarathi (Jagaiah) and Principal. She plans to disappear after the eye surgery, but Murali recognises the difference and insists that he wants the Lakshmi that served him. Movie ends with the reunion of the lovers.\n\nThe love between main characters is silent. The main characters do not have any duets. Apart from solo songs, all duets in movie are between Girija and Relangi.\n\nVB Rajendraprasad and Rangarao had produced 'Annapurna' starring Jagayya and Jamuna, which won critical acclaim but failed to rake in any money. It was a script written with ANR in mind, who did not have the dates and so the role went to Jagayya. Having lost out on money and ideas, they left to West Bengal for some cinematic inspiration. They were not disappointed; after watching a number of movies, they zeroed in on the Bengali film 'Sagarika' starring the legendary beauty Suchithra Sen and Uttam Kumar. In that movie, the lead actor Uttam Kumar goes blind only to restore his sight later. With this new idea for a Telugu movie, they left to Madras to show it to ANR, who okayed it instantly. Thus started the making of the super hit movie 'Aradhana'.\n\nThe story goes something like this: Murali Krishna (ANR) is a medical student, staying at the house of a 'sahukar' (Tradesman) whose daughter Sarala (Rajasree) is madly in love with him. Murali has eyes only for her classmate Anuradha (Savithri). Filled with jealousy, Sarala creates a rift between the duo, which are cleared later. After another love triangle involving Laxmi whose father helps Murali financially to go to London to pursue further studies, Murali loses his eyesight in a laboratory accident. Anuradha nurses him back to good health, and his eyesight is restored. All's well that ends well.\n\nWhich was the very case with 'Aradhana', as the beginning and the middle were definitely not without their share of troubles. Prominent film producer BN Reddy was shown the rushes of the movie, and he said that a movie with a romantic hero like ANR losing his eyesight will never work. Well, even experts get it wrong. The movie went on to become a great success.\n\nApart from ANR-Savithri, other characters also had important roles to play in the movie. Like the role of the Sahukar, played by Garikipati Rajarao. He lost a lot of money with the movie 'Puttillu' which introduced two actors-Jamuna and Allu Ramalingiah and took to acting in movies. Rajasree had a miniscule role in this movie, but later went on to become an established actor.\n\nJhansi, Kalyani and Rajeshwari were cast in the roles of medical students. Jhansi acted in movies like 'Sankarabharanam' and produced many movies later on, Kalyani went on to become an established dancer while Rajeshwari is the mother of the ever-popular Sridevi.\n\nDirector V. Madhusudhana Rao\n(Later known as 'Victory' Madhusudhana Rao)\nThe comedy in the movie had a purpose. The drama was intense (and overdone, like most movies those days) so to provide relief to the viewer, every intense scene would be followed by a comic interlude. Relangi's 'Dingutaka' became slang while his comedy with Girija generated many a laugh. They even had two songs picturized on them. Savithri had two songs picturized on her, while ANR, the lead, had only ONE song on him! This movie blatantly defied conventions.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 4514 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 448kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 6\nAudio Languages: Telugu\nRunTime: 2:35:42\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]   \nDuration: 2:35:42","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:defa20ede89731ca03ad69e1084fc02b1ce90e81","amp;dn":"Aradhana+%281962%29+Telugu_Xvid+1cd_No+Subs_ANR+Version+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"defa20ede89731ca03ad69e1084fc02b1ce90e81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,250,32,237,232,151,49,202,3,173,105,225,8,79,192,43,28,233,14,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
