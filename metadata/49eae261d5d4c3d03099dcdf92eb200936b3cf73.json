The Chemical Engineer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFully revised and updated, the third edition of Learning from Accidents provides more information on accident investigation, including coverage of accidents involving liquefied gases, building collapse and other incidents that have occurred because faults were invisible (e.g. underground pipelines).\r\n\r\nBy analysing accidents that have occurred Trevor Kletz shows how we can learn and thus be better able to prevent accidents happening again. Looking at a wide range of incidents, covering the process industries, nuclear industry and transportation, he analyses each accident in a practical and non-theoretical fashion and summarises each with a chain of events showing the prevention and mitigation which could have occurred at every stage. \r\n\r\nAt all times Learning from Accidents, 3rd Edition emphasises cause and prevention rather than human interest or cleaning up the mess. Anyone involved in accident investigation and reporting of whatever sort and all those who work in industry, whether in design, operations or loss prevention will find this book full of invaluable guidance and advice","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49eae261d5d4c3d03099dcdf92eb200936b3cf73","amp;dn":"Learning+from+Accidents+3rd+ed+-+Trevor+Kletz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49eae261d5d4c3d03099dcdf92eb200936b3cf73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,234,226,97,213,212,195,208,48,153,220,223,146,235,32,9,54,179,207,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
