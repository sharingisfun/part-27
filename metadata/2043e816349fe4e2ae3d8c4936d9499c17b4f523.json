Henderson, Mike Netzer, Rick Magyar, Daniel Brereton\n\nQuote from 1st issue:\n\n She is justice.\n Represented since the beginning of time as a robed woman, blinded, armed with naught but a sword and a sense of balance.\n A woman cut off from the masculine world of clues and hard realities, forced into the dephts of her remaining senses - touch, smell, taste, hearing.\n Listening. feeling.\n A woman joined with her innermost self, focused only on her mission. A woman who can not be deceived, can not be fooled.\n A woman blind...\n To all but justice\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTekno Comix published comic books between 1995 and 1997.
