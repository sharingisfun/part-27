Tried playing it with a pal and it's oookkkkk, but it's pretty basic and didn't really keep us pumped to continue (maybe it'd be cooler with 4 players). Hey though, it's free here, so if you dig top-down 4-player coop arena shooters then check it out... can't do no wrong just trying it. INSTALL AND GOOOO!!\n---------------------------------------------\n\nDescription:\nTop-down undead smashing.
