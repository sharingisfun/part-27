The controversies surrounding these relations are as alive and pressing now as at any point over the course of the past four centuries.\n\nAdrian Johnston's transcendental materialism offers a new theoretical approach to these issues. Arming himself with resources provided by German idealism, Marxism, psychoanalysis, the life sciences and contemporary philosophical developments, Johnston formulates an account of subjectivity that, although being both materialist and naturalist, does full justice to human beings as irreducible to natural matter alone. At the same time he argues against relapses into idealisms, dualisms and spiritualisms.\n\nAdventures in Transcendental Materialism elaborates Johnston's position through critical engagements with some of today's most important thinkers including Slavoj Zizek, Alain Badiou, Catherine Malabou, Jean-Claude Milner, Martin HÃƒÂ¤gglund, William Connolly, and Jane Bennett.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nSeries: Speculative Realism\nPDF: 377 pages\nPublisher: Edinburgh University Press; 1 edition (April 30, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0748673296\nISBN-13: 978-0748673292\nAmazon Link:\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c16f5db958545e71f239019062dd28537b8ab01b","amp;dn":"Adventures+in+Transcendental+Materialism%3A+Dialogues+with+Contemp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c16f5db958545e71f239019062dd28537b8ab01b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,111,93,185,88,84,94,113,242,57,1,144,98,221,40,83,123,138,176,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
