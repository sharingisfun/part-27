Based on Akira Kurosawa&amp;#039;s 1961 samurai picture Yojimbo, it scored a resounding success (in Italy in 1964 and the U.S. in 1967), as did its sequels, For a Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. The advertising campaign promoted Eastwood&amp;#039;s character--laconic, amoral, dangerous--as the Man with No Name (though in the film he&amp;#039;s clearly referred to as Joe), and audiences loved the movie&amp;#039;s refreshing new take on the Western genre. Gone are the pieties about making the streets safe for women and children. Instead it&amp;#039;s every man for himself. Striking, too, was a new emphasis on violence, with stylized, almost balletic gunfights and baroque touches such as Eastwood&amp;#039;s armored breastplate. The Dollars films had a marked influence on the Hollywood Western--for example, Sam Peckinpah&amp;#039;s The Wild Bunch--but their most enduring legacy is Clint Eastwood himself. --Edward Buscombe\n\nProduct Description\nClint Eastwood&amp;#039;s legendary &quot;Man With No Name&quot; makes his powerful debut in this thrilling, action-packed &quot;new breed of western&quot; (Motion Picture Herald) from the acclaimed director of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and For a Few Dollars More. Exploding with blistering shootouts, dynamic performances and atmospheric cinematography, it&amp;#039;s an undisputed classic of the genre. A mysterious gunman (Eastwood) has just arrived in San Miguel, a grim, dusty border town where two rival bands of smugglers are terrorizing the impoverished citizens. A master of the &quot;quick-draw,&quot;the stranger soon receives offers of employment from each gang. But his loyalty cannot be bought; he accepts both jobs...and sets in motion a plan to destroy both groups of criminals, pitting one against the other in a series of brilliantly orchestrated setups, showdowns and deadly confrontations.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9bf1ddcaf0e3d7684a545dd2704c40a3d465ae5","amp;dn":"A+Fistful+of+Dollars","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9bf1ddcaf0e3d7684a545dd2704c40a3d465ae5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,191,29,220,175,14,61,118,132,165,69,221,39,4,196,10,61,70,90,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
