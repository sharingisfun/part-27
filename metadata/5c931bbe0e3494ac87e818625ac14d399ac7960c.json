For the first time authors from many developing countries have an opportunity to write together with the most prominent world authorities. The editor has spent several years searching for the most reputable statisticians all over the world. International contributors are either presidents of the local statistical societies, or head of the Statistics department at the main university, or the most distinguished statisticians in their countries. b) to enable any non-statistician to obtain quick and yet comprehensive and highly understandable view on certain statistical term, method or application c) to enable all the researchers, managers and practicioners to refresh their knowledge in Statistics, especially in certain controversial fields. d) to revive interest in statistics among students, since they will see its usefulness and relevance in almost all branches of Science.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 1731 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (February 15, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 3642049168\n    * ISBN-13: 978-3642049163 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c931bbe0e3494ac87e818625ac14d399ac7960c","amp;dn":"International+Encyclopedia+of+Statistical+Science+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c931bbe0e3494ac87e818625ac14d399ac7960c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,147,27,190,14,52,148,172,135,232,24,98,90,193,77,57,154,199,150,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
