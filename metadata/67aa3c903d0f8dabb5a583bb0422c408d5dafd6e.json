Get the weapon you are most fit for, find comrades-in-\r\narms, explore the island to find out the truth, and punish those who\r\nravaged your world.\r\n\r\nScorched by the sun and hopelessly irradiated, the Earth is soaked in\r\ntoxic waste and blood of its former masters. Those who remain are\r\nfighting to survive the endless and senseless struggle with the\r\nenvironment, and, inevitably, with themselves.\r\n\r\nInspired by original Fallout, Krai Mira also borrows some features from\r\nsuch games as Diablo and Commandos. Though we focus on the combat\r\nsystem you will also enjoy wandering around, exploring new locations,\r\ntrading and performing quests in this post-apocalyptic world.\r\n\r\nINSTALL NOTES\r\n\r\n1.
