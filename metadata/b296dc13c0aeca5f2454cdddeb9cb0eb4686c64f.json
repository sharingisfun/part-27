When Caroline Lloyd died in 1946, she bequeathed Hall a home, $15,000 in cash, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“a roughly $10,000 portion of her estateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s annual income from shares in the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest oil companies for 38 years.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIn 1934, Hall founded the Philosophical Research Society (PRS) in Los Angeles, California, a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization[33] dedicated to the study of religion, mythology, metaphysics, and the occult.\n\nIt is claimed that Hall was made a knight patron of the Masonic Research Group of San Francisco in 1953, although he was not raised as a Freemason until 22 November 1954 into Jewel Lodge No. 374, San Francisco. He later received his 32Ã‚Â° in the Valley of San Francisco AASR (SJ). On December 8, 1973 (47 years after writing The Secret Teachings of All Ages), Hall was recognized as a 33Ã‚Â° Mason (the highest honor conferred by the Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite) at a ceremony held at the Philosophical Research Society(PRS). The definitive Manly Palmer Hall Archive states that Hall received the 33Ã‚Â°, Ã¢â‚¬Å“despite never being initiated into the physical craft.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIn his over 70-year career, Hall delivered approximately 8,000 lectures in the United States and abroad, authored over 150 books and essays, and wrote countless magazine articles. He appears in the introduction to the 1938 film When Were You Born, a murder mystery that uses astrology as a key plot point.\n- See more at: http://prs.org/wpcms/manly-p-hall/#sthash.tHBCe7mW.dpuf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b296dc13c0aeca5f2454cdddeb9cb0eb4686c64f","amp;dn":"Victory+of+the+Soul+over+Circumstance+by+Manly+P+Hall","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b296dc13c0aeca5f2454cdddeb9cb0eb4686c64f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,150,220,19,192,174,202,95,36,84,205,221,235,156,176,235,70,134,198,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
