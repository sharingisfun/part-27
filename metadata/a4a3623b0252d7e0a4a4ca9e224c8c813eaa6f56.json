Before he can be buried, OdidiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s devastated mother takes flight, leaving her picturesque home in a remote northern province. Meanwhile, OdidiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grieving sister, Arabel Ajani, must confront the OgandasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ demons. \n\nCaine PrizeÃ¢â‚¬â€œwinner OwuorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prose, though sometimes too sentimental, is both quixotic and archly descriptive. And while the author may spill a great deal of ink exploring her protagonistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s consuming passions and Ã¢â‚¬Å“the kernel of all their deepest yearnings,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ her writing is exceptionally chiseled and achieves a poetic dimension. \n\nOdidi had an Ã¢â‚¬Å“addiction to water songsÃ¢â‚¬â€a liturgy of flowing, bubbliness. Even the camels listened to him. Rock-drill laughter, excavating terror; salt in soup; no sugar in tea made from rangeland herbs.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The author is as at ease evoking the mystical, inflamed Ogandas and the magical Northern Frontier District as she is deconstructing a family of British expatriates, the Boltons, whose destiny intersects with OdidiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The country chose its prey. \n\nSeduced them, made them believe they owned it, and then it gobbled them down, often in the most tender of waysÃ¢â‚¬â€like a python.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ There is hardly any aspect of Kenya that Owuor seems unable to tackle with her unique flair in this masterfully executed novel, from the midÃ¢â‚¬â€œ20th centuryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mau Mau rebellion and its aftermath to the stirring personal destinies of her sundry cast of characters.\n\nGenre: Historical Novel | Debut Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4a3623b0252d7e0a4a4ca9e224c8c813eaa6f56","amp;dn":"Dust+by+Yvonne+Adhiambo+Owuor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4a3623b0252d7e0a4a4ca9e224c8c813eaa6f56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,163,98,59,2,82,215,224,164,164,202,158,34,76,140,129,62,170,111,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
