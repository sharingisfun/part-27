The way the dead bodies are positioned shows that the unsub is remorseful about his act. They know that the unsub needs to be a physically strong man to be able to exact such killings on other physically strong men. Subsequent victims are found to be beaten solely by the unsub's hands, and that the unsub is no longer showing that remorse, which to the team indicates that he will probably strike again for his new pleasure of blood lust. The nature of the beatings also shows someone who is knowledgeable about fighting, such as a boxer. Hence the team digs into the world of the Philadelphia boxing scene trying to find some connection to the location of the dead body sites near the hospital. Meanwhile, Hotch contemplates going on his first date since Meredith's death.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9eaf71d74943d1beb10ae34f5c83a3b653ac8eaf","amp;dn":"Criminal+Minds+Season+7+Episode+10+The+Bittersweet+Science","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9eaf71d74943d1beb10ae34f5c83a3b653ac8eaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,175,113,215,73,67,209,190,177,10,227,79,92,131,163,182,83,172,142,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
