The scientific principles behind industrial chocolate manufacture are outlined with detailed explanations of the various stages of chocolate manufacturing including mixing, refining, conching and tempering. Other topics covered include the chemistry of flavour formation and development during cocoa processing and chocolate manufacture; volatile flavour compounds and their characteristics and identification; sensory descriptions and character; and flavour release and perception in chocolate. The nutritional and health benefits of cocoa and chocolate consumption are also addressed.\r\n\r\nThere is a focus throughout on those factors that influence the flavour and quality characteristics of the finished chocolate and that provide scope for process optimization and improvement. The book is designed to be a desk reference for all those engaged in the business of making and using chocolate worldwide; confectionery and chocolate scientists in industry and academia; students and practising food scientists and technologists; nutritionists and other health professionals; and libraries of institutions where food science is studied and researched. * an overview of the science behind chocolate manufacture * covers the whole process from cocoa production, through manufacturing, to the nutrition and health aspects of chocolate consumption * focuses on factors that influence chocolate flavour and quality, and that provide scope for process optimization and improvement","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc4dd39a0805a3eb62c62ba46c69cbe60a64f428","amp;dn":"Chocolate+Science+and+Technology+-+Emmanuel+Ohene+Afoakwa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc4dd39a0805a3eb62c62ba46c69cbe60a64f428","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,77,211,154,8,5,163,235,98,198,43,164,108,105,203,230,10,100,244,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
