The head of the expedition, an Indiana Jones type, has his plans for a successful trip spoiled though, after his helicopter is brought down by a flock of strange enormous birds and to add to his troubles, he also has to look after his stowaway son Luke. Luke is the film's main narrator; with an arsenal of personal cameras at his disposal, the young techno-geek captures every minute of this project, which becomes a lesson in survival. The team quickly discover all is not well in the jungle, and encounter some extraordinary creatures, which civilization has presumed extinct for millions of years!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:415aad936719d8d27e6a22eba3543e5aa5107b97","amp;dn":"The+Dinosaur+Project+2012+BRRip+XviD+IAMHUNGRY.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"415aad936719d8d27e6a22eba3543e5aa5107b97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,90,173,147,103,25,216,210,126,106,34,235,163,84,62,90,165,16,123,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
