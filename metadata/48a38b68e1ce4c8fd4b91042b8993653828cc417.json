Pampel\n\n\nPublisher:   Facts on File\nNumber Of Pages:   284\nPublication Date:   2010-07-30\nISBN-10 / ASIN:   0816080143\nISBN-13 / EAN:   9780816080144\nPrescription drugs help people manage such medical conditions as severe depression, high blood pressure, asthma, arthritis, and diabetes. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, adults spend nearly $73 billion per year on prescription drugs. Pharmaceutical companies have increased demand for their products by advertising to patients and marketing to the physicians who prescribe drugsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½practices that critics condemn. The more prescription drugs a person takes, the more likely the drugs will interact in ways that are harmful. Errors in prescribing are another hazard, and even legitimate prescription drugs have recently been subject to recalls due to contamination.\n\nAre prescription drugs getting to the people who need them most? Are they being overprescribed and overused? Are prices too high? Prescription Drugs introduces readers to the controversies associated with popular prescription drugs and shows how Americans have attempted to balance the goals of access and safety.\n\nCoverage includes:\n\nThe Pure Food and Drug Act (1906), which prohibited interstate commerce in adulterated drugs\nThe Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act (1970), which classified drugs based on their potential for abuse and set criminal punishments for five different schedules of drugs\nUpjohn v. Finch (1970), in which the federal court ruled that commercial success alone does not constitute substantial evidence of drug safety and efficacy\nThe Prescription Drug Marketing Act (1987), which allowed direct-to-consumer advertising\nThe Prescription Drug User Fee Act (1992), which required the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry to pay user fees to help cover the FDA costs of drug reviews\nPharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America v. Walsh (2003), in which the Supreme Court affirmed that states have the right to compel drug manufacturers to subsidize price discounts for prescription drugs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48a38b68e1ce4c8fd4b91042b8993653828cc417","amp;dn":"Library+In+A+Book+-+Prescription+Drugs.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48a38b68e1ce4c8fd4b91042b8993653828cc417","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,163,139,104,225,206,76,143,212,185,16,66,184,153,54,83,130,140,196,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
