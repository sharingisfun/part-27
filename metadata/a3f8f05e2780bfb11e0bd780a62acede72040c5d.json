Structure would exist as a point\nof reference, and as a bare roadmap, but other than that caution would be thrown\nto the wind as the group explored and innovated within these loose frameworks.\n\n\nAs is the case with all of the Miles reissue series, Seven Steps: The Complete\nColumbia Recordings of Miles Davis 1963-1964 has been painstakingly\nremastered. Some shows are better than othersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the monaural Miles in Berlin has,\nmost likely, been made to sound as good as possible given what is on the original\ntapes, but it doesn't have the crystalline clarity of the '64 New York Philharmonic\nrecordings. But that is a minor quibble. Across the seven discs, even where the\nrecording quality is less-than even, the performances sparkle. And the listener\nfinally has the opportunity to put these years in perspective and follow the\nemergence of a group that, while not properly acclaimed during its existence, has\ngone on to be considered the most inventive band of Miles Davis' long career.\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n\nMiles Davis (trumpet), Ron Carter (bass), George Coleman (tenor saxophone on\ndiscs 1-5), Victor Feldman (piano on disc 1), Frank Butler (drums on disc 1), Herbie\nHancock (piano on discs 2-7), Tony Williams (drums on discs 2-7), Sam Rivers\n(tenor saxophone on disc 6), Wayne Shorter (tenor saxophone on disc 7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.
