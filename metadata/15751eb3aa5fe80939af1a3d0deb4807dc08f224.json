Even though events didn't turn out that way, his story is more interesting than the musicians who did find success. Indeed, the sleevenotes tell the tale of a man born Howard Jones and who had the chance to be the frontman for a nascent Iron Maiden. But however different things could have been, at least there's a chance for those who missed out first time to discover a 1975 album that ranks as a great &quot;lost&quot; treasure. With a sound midway between the flamboyant piano-led pop-rock of Elton John and the rich melodrama and tragic story-telling of Scott Walker, the album begins superbly with a strident 'Goodbye Suzie' but its tale of suicide meant that it was deemed unfit for Radio 1 at the time. On the other side of the coin, 'Maybe Someday In Miami' and 'Family Man' verge on high camp but Howard's enthusiasm and ear for a tune win through. On a more heartfelt level, 'Gone Away' is the man at his towering, romantic peak. Even the bonus tracks stand out, particularly the Fred and Ginger tribute, 'Pearl Parade'. Thankfully Howard is now receiving the attention he deserved at the time, albeit 28 years after the event.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15751eb3aa5fe80939af1a3d0deb4807dc08f224","amp;dn":"John+Howard+-+Kid+in+a+Big+World+%5B1975%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15751eb3aa5fe80939af1a3d0deb4807dc08f224","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,117,30,179,170,95,232,9,57,175,26,61,13,235,72,7,220,8,242,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
