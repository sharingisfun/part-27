As health care professionals you will often encounter women of\nchildbearing age who may be pregnant, or you may have children of your own, or maybe it is a friend who is pregnant. In any case, pregnancy and childbirth are relevant to all of us, and unfortunately, these processes often culminate in negative outcomes. For example, 50% of all embryos are spontaneously aborted. Further more, prematurity and birth defects are the leading causes of infant mortality and major contributors to disabilities.\nFortunately, new strategies can improve pregnancy outcomes, and health care professionals have a major role to play in implementing these initiatives. However, a basic knowledge of embryology is essential to the success of these strategies, and with this knowledge, every health care professional can play a role in providing healthier babies.\nTo accomplish its goal of providing a basic understanding of embryology and its clinical relevance, LangmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Medical Embryology retains its unique approach of combining an economy of text with excellent diagrams and clinical images.\nIt stresses the clinical importance of the subject by providing numerous clinical examples that result from abnormal embryological events. The following pedagogic features and updates in the 12th edition help facilitate student learning.\n\nCONTENTS\nPart 1 General Embryology 01\nChapter 1 / Introduction to Molecular Regulation and Signaling 3\nChapter 2 / Gametogenesis: Conversion of Germ Cells into Male and Female Gametes 10\nChapter 3 / First Week of Development: Ovulation to Implantation 29\nChapter 4 / Second Week of Development: Bilaminar Germ Disc 43\nChapter 5 / Third Week of Development: Trilaminar Germ Disc 51\nChapter 6 / Third to Eighth Weeks: The Embryonic Period 63\nChapter 7 / The Gut Tube and the Body Cavities 86\nChapter 8 / Third Month to Birth: The Fetus and Placenta 96\nChapter 9 / Birth Defects and Prenatal Diagnosis 117\n\nPart 2 Systems-Based Embryology 131\nChapter 10 / The Axial Skeleton 133\nChapter 11 / Muscular System 145\nChapter 12 / Limbs 151\nChapter 13 / Cardiovascular System 162\nChapter 14 / Respiratory System 201\nChapter 15 / Digestive System 208\nChapter 16 / Urogenital System 232\nChapter 17 / Head and Neck 260\nChapter 18 / Central Nervous\nChapter 19 / Ear 321\nChapter 20 / Eye 329\nChapter 21 / Integumentary System 339\n\nPart 3 Appendix 345\nAnswers to Problems 347\nFigure Credits 357\nGlossary of Key Terms 361\nIndex 371\n\ncover &lt;a href=&quot; http://img846.imageshack.us/img846/6701/langmansmedicalembyrolo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://img846.imageshack.us/img846/6701/langmansmedicalembyrolo.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d9d6cd4ad0e3579733b244b97fd84208897efe3","amp;dn":"Langman%27s+Medical+Embyrology+%2812th+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d9d6cd4ad0e3579733b244b97fd84208897efe3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,157,108,212,173,14,53,121,115,59,36,75,151,253,132,32,136,151,239,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
