In 2000, Jeff Lynne found a new impetus to work on the music of his old band and returned to the recording studio to work on an ELO project for the first time in some 15 years just prior to the comeback Zoom in 2001 resulting in a digitally remastered compilation released in late 2000. Unlike its predecessors, this project was personally approved and endorsed by band leader Jeff Lynne. The set includes songs featured from all 11 studio albums up to that point, including an edit of &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot; from their live album The Night the Light Went on (in Long Beach), plus some new recordings amongst the bands extensive back catalog, most notably a reworking of Lynne's only UK number one hit &quot;Xanadu&quot;. The album includes liner notes on each song from Jeff Lynne and a booklet inside.\n\nAmazon.com Review By Mike McGonigal - Electric Light Orchestra are the quintessential fanboy (or fangirl) band; folks tend to either love or hate Jeff Lynne's far-reaching pop act, while critics tend to wrinkle their nose in disgust and dismiss their entire oeuvre save the obscure first album that Roy Wood plays on. Basically, E.L.O. are derided for writing all the Beatles songs that the Beatles never got around to writing in the first place, and then slapping sappy disco string arrangements on top. But at their best this ambitious ensemble--whose maxim is to try and cram as much sound and scope as possible into the conventional pop song--achieve a certain lumbering grace which is amazingly pleasurable. Sure, their songs are sappy and Lynne's lyrics campy, but Lynne is such a master that he transforms artifice into art; he's not the Beethoven of rock, he's its Jeff Koons. Moreover, Lynne is no mere retro futurist; he is fully capable of taking apart high-, low-, and middle-brow genres and recombining them in unexpected ways--in a manner that foreshadows pop music's direction in the 1990s. It's delightful to see this underrated group get a decent, career-spanning three-CD box set (digitally remastered, natch), with the requisite unreleased/alternate takes and elaborate color booklet with extensive liner notes. This music has aged remarkably well, like a fine can of soda pop.\n\nTrack Listings  \n\n[01] 10538 Overture\n[02] Showdown\n[03] Ma-Ma-Ma Belle\n[04] Mr. Radio\n[05] Roll Over Beethoven\n[06] Mama [New Edit]\n[07] One Summer Dream\n[08] Illusions In G Major\n[09] Strange Magic\n[10] Eldorado Overture\n[11] Can't Get It Out Of My Head\n[12] Eldorado\n[13] Eldorado - Finale\n[14] Do Ya [Unedited Alternative Mix]\n[15] Mister Kingdom\n[16] Grieg's Piano Concerto In A Minor\n\n\tDisc 01 Play Time 01h:08m:45s\n\nTrack Listings  \n\n[01] Tightrope\n[02] Evil Woman\n[03] Livin' Thing\n[04] Mr. Blue Sky\n[05] Mission (A World Record) [Alternative Mix]\n[06] Turn To Stone\n[07] Telephone Line\n[08] Rockaria!\n[09] Starlight\n[10] It's Over\n[11] The Whale\n[12] Sweet Talkin' Woman\n[13] Big Wheels\n[14] Shangri - La\n[15] Nightrider\n[16] Tears In Your Life\n\n\tDisc 02 Play Time 01h:10m:54s\n\nTrack Listings  ---&gt; \n\n[01] Don't Bring Me Down\n[02] Diary Of Horace Wimp\n[03] Twilight\n[04] Secret Messages\n[05] Take Me On And On\n[06] Shine A Little Love\n[07] Rock And Roll Is King\n[08] Last Train To London\n[09] Confusion\n[10] Getting To The Point\n[11] Hold On Tight\n[12] So Serious\n[13] Calling America\n[14] Four Little Diamonds\n[15] Great Balls Of Fire [Live]\n[16] Xanadu [New Version]\n[17] Indian Queen [Demo]\n[18] Love Changes All\n[19] After All\n[20] Helpless\n[21] Who's That\n\n\tDisc 03 Play Time 01h:13m:33s\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 03h:33m:12s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 577mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v.9.0.0.70 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Rock\nRelease Date\t&gt; 21 November 2000 (US) 11 December 2000 (UK)\nRecord Company\t&gt; Sony Music\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt; http://www.elo.biz\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Light_Orchestra\n&gt; http://oldielyrics.com/e/electric_light_orchestra.html\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:982356a92afbf0f906ee1040f390e62edb28aa0e","amp;dn":"%5B2000%5D+Flashback+-+Electric+Light+Orchestra+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"982356a92afbf0f906ee1040f390e62edb28aa0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,35,86,169,42,251,240,249,6,238,16,64,243,144,230,46,219,40,170,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
