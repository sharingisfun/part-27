Vic, a pornographer, and Charlie, a shady attorney, have stolen two million dollars from their mob boss, and they need to appear calm for a few hours until their planned early morning departure. Vic, who&amp;#039;s storing the money, is cool, but Charlie is nervous, especially when their boss&amp;#039;s enforcer shows up looking for him. As the night drags on, Charlie does a favor for Renata, the lovely manager of one of the strip clubs, rescues his ex-wife&amp;#039;s husband from a drunken public display, drops in on his ex-in-laws, sees his kids, and, between phone calls and visits to Renata, goes looking for Vic. Charlie&amp;#039;s troubles are just beginning.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a39243050efc19dfaf1e4f42569911297f3dddd9","amp;dn":"The.Ice.Harvest.DVDRip.XviD-DiAMOND","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a39243050efc19dfaf1e4f42569911297f3dddd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,146,67,5,14,252,25,223,175,30,79,66,86,153,17,41,127,61,221,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
