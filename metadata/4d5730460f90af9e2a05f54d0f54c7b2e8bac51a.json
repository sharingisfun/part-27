Hailing from El Paso, TX, this four-piece was active in the late &amp;#039;60s and early &amp;#039;70s. It recorded a studio session in 1971 for the Suemi label, out of which two singles came out. Success -- and the projected LP -- never materialized. Thanks to Suemi&amp;#039;s archiving care, the Shadoks imprint was able to retrieve this lost album in 2003. Iota had little money and Suemi spent little more on them: The eight-track tapes sound thin and under-produced, but the music features enough original quirks to catch the interest of &amp;#039;70s psychedelic/acid rock collectors. To the standard post-Cream power trio, Iota added Hammond organ (played by Steve Phipps), which takes the group&amp;#039;s sound closer to early Deep Purple, especially in &quot;Sing for You.&quot; The highlight of the set is &quot;Precincts,&quot; the group&amp;#039;s first single A-side. A dark, moody song mixed with lots of cavernous bass, it is unusual even by heavy psych rock standards and features a gripping melody delivered with much drama by leader Carl Neer. &quot;Love Come Wicked,&quot; &quot;Bottle Baby,&quot; and &quot;Better Place&quot; also stand as nicely written songs and walk the line separating blues-rock and psych rock. More overtly pop, &quot;I&amp;#039;m Gonna Be a Man&quot; and &quot;Our Love So Warm&quot; are less successful. ~ Francois Couture, All Music Guide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d5730460f90af9e2a05f54d0f54c7b2e8bac51a","amp;dn":"Iota+-+Iota+-+1969+%28Blues-rock%2C+Psychedelic%2C+Acid+Rock%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d5730460f90af9e2a05f54d0f54c7b2e8bac51a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,87,48,70,15,144,175,158,42,5,245,77,15,84,199,178,232,186,197,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
