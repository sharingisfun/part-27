Of course, we included basic delay models like a simple mono delay and a stereo delay, but also a tape-sound delay which allows you to change tape length without any clicks. The delays, filters, and reverser can all be modulated by the built-in modulators. There are 4 modulation sequencers, 4 LFO's, and 4 envelopes, complete with several trigger options!\n\nThere are many other new features and options for you to discover which aren't mentioned here, so go ahead, take the plunge, and dig into the brand new experience of RP-Delay.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo the right thing and support good devs!\nC0PYL3FT3R a.k.a. 23K! - 2014\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nthepiratebay.se - 1337x.to - flashtorrents.org - fenopy.se\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXIV (07).\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de1bce8fe5e0797e6306b33769c85a32bcdddd72","amp;dn":"Rob+Papen+-+RP-Delay+v1.0.1g+-+OS+X+%5BC0PYL3FT3R%5D%5Bpacket-dada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de1bce8fe5e0797e6306b33769c85a32bcdddd72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,27,206,143,229,224,121,126,99,6,179,55,105,200,90,50,188,221,221,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
