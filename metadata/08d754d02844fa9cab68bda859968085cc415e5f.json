Songs You Know By Heart is a solid offering of Buffett's greatest hits, pulling together his truly strongest material and avoiding the unnecessary filler that appears on his albums. His claim to fame, &quot;Margaritaville,&quot; is the jewel in the crown here, which still harbors that tropical feel thanks to its Caribbean-styled rhythm and relaxed flow.\n\n&quot;Come Monday&quot; picks up where &quot;Margaritaville&quot; leaves off, only this ballad plays out with subdued sincerity and has Buffett sounding strangely serious, and romantic. Most of the songs from Buffett are centered around his frolicking lifestyle, like the comical &quot;Cheeseburger in Paradise&quot; or the naughtiness of &quot;Why Don't We Get Drunk,&quot; an ode to his party-filled outlook on life.\n\nBuffett's voice shines on the clever &quot;Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes,&quot;\nwhich again spotlights his love of living without concern, especially in someplace\nwarm. The catchy and whimsical &quot;Fins&quot; is lifted by a contagious pace with a smart\nchorus and serves as one of the highlights of this collection. As a compilation, this bunch of Jimmy Buffett's most famous tunes contains just the right amount of tracks. Any less would be inconsistent and any more would be deemed as overkill.\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Cheeseburger in paradise                             [02:52]\n02.He went to paris                                     [03:30]\n03.Fins                                                 [03:25]\n04.Son of A son of A sailor                             [03:25]\n05.A pirate looks at forty                              [03:52]\n06.Margaritaville                                       [04:12]\n07.Come monday                                          [03:09]\n08.Changes in latitudes, changes in attitudes           [03:16]\n09.Why don't we get drunk                               [02:43]\n10.Pencil thin mustache                                 [02:50]\n11.Grapefruit-Juicy fruit                               [02:57]\n12.Boat drinks                                          [02:38]\n13.Volcano                                              [03:38]\n________\n42:27 min\n 62,0 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
