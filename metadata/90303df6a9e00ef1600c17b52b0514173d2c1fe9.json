Restructured to fit Egoyan's signature mosaic narrative style, the story concerns the cultural aftershocks which tear apart a small British Columbia town in the wake of a school-bus accident which leaves a number of local children dead. Ian Holm stars as Mitchell Stephens, a big-city lawyer who arrives in the interest of uniting the survivors to initiate a lawsuit; his maneuvering only drives the community further apart, reopening old wounds and jeopardizing any hopes of emotional recovery. Like so many of Egoyan's features, The Sweet Hereafter is a serious and painfully honest exploration of family grief; no character is immune from the sense of utter devastation which grips the film, not even the attorney, whose interests are in part motivated by his own remorse over the fate of his daughter, an HIV-positive drug addict.\n\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / Spanish / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90303df6a9e00ef1600c17b52b0514173d2c1fe9","amp;dn":"The+Sweet+Hereafter+1997+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90303df6a9e00ef1600c17b52b0514173d2c1fe9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,48,61,246,169,224,14,241,96,12,23,181,43,5,20,23,61,44,31,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
