Introductory chapters sort through the complexities, from abusers' distorting of sacred texts to justifying their actions to survivors' conflicting feelings toward their faith. The core of the book surveys findings on gender violence across Christian, Jewish, Islamic, Eastern, and Indigenous traditions--both attitudes that promote abuse and spiritual resources that can be used to promote healing. Best practices are included for appropriate treatment of survivors, their children, and abusers; and for partnering with communities and clergy toward stemming violence against women.\r\n\r\nAmong the topics featured:\r\n\r\nEcclesiastical policies vs. lived social relationships: gender parity, attitudes, and ethics.\r\nWomenâ€™s spiritual struggles and resources to cope with intimate partner aggression.\r\nChristian stereotypes and violence against North Americaâ€™s native women.\r\nAddressing intimate partner violence in rural church communities.\r\nCollaboration between community service agencies and faith-based institutions.\r\nProviding hope in faith communities: creating a domestic violence policy for families.\r\nReligion and Men's Violence against Women will gain a wide audience among psychologists, social workers, marriage and family therapists, and other mental health professionals who treat religious clients or specialize in treating survivors and perpetrators of domestic and intimate partner violence, stalking, sexual assault, rape, or human trafficking","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:584d5f7135a961d0de850914175dde1034178891","amp;dn":"Religion+and+Men%27s+Violence+Against+Women+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"584d5f7135a961d0de850914175dde1034178891","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,77,95,113,53,169,97,208,222,133,9,20,23,93,222,16,52,23,136,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
