Those limitations are not part of our &quot;original equipment.&quot; In the words of bestselling author and beloved teacher Guy Finley, &quot;When you realize no one else on this earth can be like you... that no other soul may know the beauty, sorrow, light and darkness you alone are given to see, then you will no longer want to be like anyone else on this earth. You will, at last, be the fearless individual your heart of hearts has called you to be.&quot;\n\nThere is a world of wisdom in this small gem of a book. Guy Finley is a master at opening our eyes, ears, and hearts to the plain and simple truths of this life. We are not our sense of inadequacy, our compulsions, our defeated thoughts and feelings. We can choose the fearless path because we were, in fact, born fearless.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97724441cf82007e3b36757c9093ce15bcff8fb8","amp;dn":"The+courage+to+be+free+-+epub%2Bmobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97724441cf82007e3b36757c9093ce15bcff8fb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,114,68,65,207,130,0,126,59,54,117,124,144,147,206,21,188,255,143,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
