Gus Carpenter, executive editor of the Pine County Pilot, sets out to solve the mystery with the help of his old flame and now girlfriend, Pine County sheriff deputy Darlene Esper. As Gus and Darlene investigate, they canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help but question if GracieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s troubled life really ended in suicide or if the suspicious crime-scene evidence adds up to murder. \nBut in such a small town itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impossible to be an impartial investigatorÃ¢â‚¬â€Gracie was GusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second cousin; DarleneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best friend; and the lover of GusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s oldest pal, Soupy Campbell. Yet with all the bad blood between Gus and Gracie over the years, Gus is easily distracted by other problems. His employer is trying to push him out, the locals are annoyed that his stories have halted construction on a new hockey rink, and DarleneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s estranged husband has returned to reclaim his wife. \n\nWhen Gus tries to retrace GracieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s steps to discover what happened to her in the eighteen years she was away from Starvation Lake, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forced to return to Detroit, the scene of his humiliating past. And though heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s determined to find out what drove Gracie back home, Gus is unprepared for the terrible secrets he uncovers. \n\nThe second book in Bryan GruleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s irresistible Starvation Lake series, The Hanging Tree is a compelling story about family and friendship, sex and violence, and the failure of love to make everything right. \n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2e28c1351cfb948207214fc807e25a5d83c5622","amp;dn":"The+Hanging+Tree+-+Bryan+Gruley+-+Book+2+Starvation+Lake+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2e28c1351cfb948207214fc807e25a5d83c5622","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,226,140,19,81,207,185,72,32,114,20,252,128,126,37,165,216,60,86,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
