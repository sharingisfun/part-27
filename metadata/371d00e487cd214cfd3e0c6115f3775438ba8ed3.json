This series visits the crucial moments in life's journey to dominate the earth. Seas of Life reveals that the basic blueprint of a brain, backbone, two legs and two arms was created in the ocean. Land Grab follows life as it changes from a fish to a human; and Airborne illustrates the four evolutions of flight. In Living Together, relationships - predatory, competitive and co-operative - are revealed. And in Human Life, the differences between us and chimps, phenomenally similar creatures, are examined. The latest graphic techniques recreate evolution before your very eyes, providing viewers with a spectacular representation of how life came to be.\n\n\n\nPresented by: Steve Leonard\n---------------------------\n\n\n\nTitle: Journey Of Life-Land Grab\nYear:  2005\nFile Size: 700 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:58:54\nVideo Codec: DivX5\nVideo Resolution: 704x384\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1622 kbit/s\nFPS:  25.000000\nAudio Bitrate: 192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: (AC3)\nChannels:  2 \nSubtitles: (External English)\n \n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455259/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455259/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\nNote: External English subtitle included.\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor father information and pictures of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at   \n\nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\nTips:For better background view chance the &quot;Style Chooser&quot; at the bottom left \ncorner to &quot;graphite_x&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:371d00e487cd214cfd3e0c6115f3775438ba8ed3","amp;dn":"Journey+Of+Life-Land+Grab%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"371d00e487cd214cfd3e0c6115f3775438ba8ed3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,29,0,228,135,205,33,76,253,62,12,97,21,243,119,84,56,186,142,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
