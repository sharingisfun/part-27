He grew up with a secret that cost him everythingÃ¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€his birthright, his family, and his military career. In all his life, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only had one love, and he has sacrificed his own happiness to see his best friend reunited with the woman he loves. But now that his good deed is done, he feels lost and adrift. Even though they do their best to include him in their new family, Maris is once again on the outside looking in.\n\n Ture has spent his life hiding from everyone around himÃ¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€his family, the world, you name itÃ¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€while trying desperately to fit in. Badly hurt by everyone heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever known, he trusts no one except his own best friend. And honestly, he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand why he trusts her. Nor can he believe her when she describes a loyalty between friends the likes of which heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never seen.\n\nBut when Ture is in his darkest hour, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s saved by a hero he thought only existed in novels. A man who is every bit as scarred and mistrusting as he isÃ¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€one who has no interest in being dragged into another relationship with anyone.\n\n Having spent his life as a living study of doomed relationships, Maris is well aware of the courtship and fiasco that invariably follows. Still, there is something about Ture he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t resist. Something that wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let him walk away when he knows he should.\n\n But when old enemies return to threaten them both, they either have to stand together or die alone.\n\n\nFollow me on twitter: @livhre\nRequest books on twitter: @livhre\nPlease seed and rate the torrents I upload. Go to kobobooks.com and choose books that you want uploaded and request them in the comments.\nNote: Comics on that site are in some weird ass format that only works on iOS and Android. To get those I have to go through the tired process of screen shots of each page, then create a word file, then convert to epub. Its a pain because even then the images may not show up right on some devices/apps.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a85473d7edc10028b927ff1dd5ea7a701da1ba4","amp;dn":"Cloak+%26amp%3B+Silence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a85473d7edc10028b927ff1dd5ea7a701da1ba4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,133,71,61,126,220,16,2,139,146,127,241,221,94,167,167,1,218,27,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
