Inside a weird, very un-hard rock cover lies a very good album. The band opted for a slightly harder edge and a more guitar-oriented sound, but at the same time they managed to write some great hooks and melodies. They even had their first chart-topping hit with the single &quot;Banging On Drums&quot; and made a video for the title track (an epic ballad), filmed in the suitably grandiose surroundings of their home area in Lapland.\n\nThe aforementioned single hit opens the album, a fierce rocker with a good chorus. &quot;Drag Me To The Moon&quot; features another excellent chorus, while &quot;Angel Of Mercy&quot; borrows a little from Kiss&amp;#039; &quot;Heaven&amp;#039;s On Fire&quot; without being a full-on rip-off. Next up there&amp;#039;s &quot;Dump Me&quot;, arguably one of the finest songs of the band with a killer chorus. The stomping &quot;No Man&amp;#039;s Land&quot; and more uptempo &quot;Cut&quot; follow, both good, solid tracks. The title track sees the band moving into a different direction, as it is a majestic, almost progressive ballad that reminds me of QueensrÃƒÂ¿che and the likes.\n\nThe last four tracks lead us back the more familiar waters. &quot;To The Crux&quot; is a decent hard rocker, &quot;Na Na Naa&quot; a catcy, simple sing-along anthem originally recorded by Cozy Powell, &quot;To The Mountain&quot; a frantic, yet melodic track while the closing number &quot;Under The Freeway&quot; represents the more thoughtful side of the band, with some neat tempo changes and somewhat weird lyrics.\n\n320kbps CBR / Tot. size 97,4Mb\n\nTrack list:\n\n1.
