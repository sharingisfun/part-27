If Love Whispers Your Name (Acoustic Demo Version \n\nDream Attic heralds the return of Richard Thompson, one of the most distinguished guitarists and songwriters of our time, with a magnificent collection of 13 new songs. \n\nPenned during a short and inspired burst of creative outpouring, the songs were performed during a West Coast tour in February 2010 and the bulk of the performances that made the album come from three shows at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco. &quot;I don't think musicians playing on their own are particularly interesting, it's only when they play in front of an audience that something interesting happens&quot; said Thompson in an interview at one of the shows. \n\nThe album opens explosively with &quot;The Money Shuffle&quot;, which Thompson says is &quot;dedicated to our good friends on Wall Street who did such a fine job lately...it's just a mild satire&quot;. The resulting take is the antithesis of mild, building towards an absolutely scalding guitar solo. From this bracing start, the sequence rolls through traditionally rooted balladry (&quot;Among the Gorse, Among the Grey&quot;, an intriguing, sharply-drawn character study (&quot;Here Comes Geordie), image-filled observations (&quot;Burning Man&quot;) and recollections of bygone eras (&quot;Demons in Her Dancing Shoes&quot;). &quot;Sidney Wells&quot; is a traditional murder ballad in modern dress, &quot;Crimescene&quot; is a raging reaction to the inexorable aging process. &quot;A Brother Slips Away&quot; is a moving elegy to friends the 61-year-old Thompson has lost within the last year and &quot;Big Sun Falling in the River&quot; is a bouyantly Beatlesque instant classic. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a11434cbd892f94b89b5561cea39a89535f9293","amp;dn":"Richard+Thompson...Dream+Attic%28limited+edition%29%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a11434cbd892f94b89b5561cea39a89535f9293","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,17,67,76,189,137,47,148,184,155,85,97,206,163,154,137,83,95,146,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
