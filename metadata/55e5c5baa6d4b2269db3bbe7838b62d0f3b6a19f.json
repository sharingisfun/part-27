Despite being in different generations, they work together quite well on this radio broadcast, which also includes pianist Kenny Drew, bassist Bo Stief and drummer Ed Thigpen. Released for the first time on a 1998 CD as part of TCB's Swiss Radio Days jazz series, the set has individual features for the tenors (Webster is excellent on &quot;Sunday&quot; and Gordon greatly uplifts &quot;Didn't We&quot;) and jams on &quot;Blues in F&quot; and &quot;Perdido&quot; that are more complementary than competitive. It is a pleasure hearing Webster and Gordon play side by side.
