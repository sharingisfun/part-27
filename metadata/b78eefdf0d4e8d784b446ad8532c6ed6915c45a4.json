He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis &quot;Red&quot; Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA) ... http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/releaseinfo\nSpanish ..............[ Cadena Perpetua, SueÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±os de Libertad\nGerman ...............[ Die Verurteilten\nFrench ...............[ Les ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°vadÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s, ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â€šÂ¬ l'ombre de Shawshank\nItalian ..............[ Le Ali Della LibertÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â \nPolish ...............[ Skazani na Shawshank\nPortuguese (Portugal) [ Os Condenados de Shawshank\nPortuguese (Brazil) ..[ Um Sonho de Liberdade\nRussian ..............[ Ãƒï¿½Ã…Â¸Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â±Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â³ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â· Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¨Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒâ€˜Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€˜Ã‹â€ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂºÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â°\nCzech ................[ VykoupenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­ z vÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Âºznice Shawshank\nRomanian .............[ Inchisoarea Ingerilor\n\nCast: Tim Robbins (Andy Dufresne), Morgan Freeman (Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding), Bob Gunton (Warden Norton), William Sadler (Heywood), Clancy Brown (Captain Hadley), Gil Bellows (Tommy), Mark Rolston (Bogs Diamond), James Whitmore (Brooks Hatlen), Jeffrey DeMunn (1946 D.A.), Larry Brandenburg (Skeet), Neil Giuntoli (Jigger), Brian Libby (Floyd), David Proval (Snooze), Joseph Ragno (Ernie), Jude Ciccolella (Guard Mert), All Cast &amp; Crew... http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/fullcredits#cast\n\nSoundtrack: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/soundtrack\n\nUSE DIRECT FROM PC to TV - DVI or VGA CONNECTORS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b78eefdf0d4e8d784b446ad8532c6ed6915c45a4","amp;dn":"The.Shawshank.Redemption%5B1994%5DDVDRip.x264-m99m","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b78eefdf0d4e8d784b446ad8532c6ed6915c45a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,142,239,223,13,78,141,120,75,68,106,216,83,44,110,214,145,92,69,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
