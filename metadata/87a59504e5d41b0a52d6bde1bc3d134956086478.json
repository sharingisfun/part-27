PhotoZoom Pro 5 is equipped with S-Spline Max, a unique, patented image resize technology which excels at preserving clean edges, sharpness, and fine details.\n\nEven noisy, compressed originals can be enlarged successfully. Normally, noise and JPEG compression artifacts become disturbingly visible during enlargement. PhotoZoom Pro 5 however offers the tools to eliminate these distortions. You'll be amazed by the amount of detail PhotoZoom Pro 5 is able to dig up from below the mess.\n\nPhotoZoom Pro 5 is extremely easy to use, and comes with various pre-defined settings. These settings can be manually fine-tuned as well. You can even put together your own resize profiles: compilations of your favorite resize method and size settings, which can be selected with a single click. When you often use the same settings, resize profiles will streamline your workflow.\n\nLarge quantities of images can be resized in one go, through batch processing. Multi-processor support, 64-bit support, and the new GPU acceleration included with PhotoZoom Pro 5 ensure reduced processing time.\n\nPhotoZoom Pro 5 works both as a stand-alone application and as a plug-in for various host programs, such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Photoshop Elements, Corel PHOTO-PAINT, and Corel PaintShop Pro\n\nOptimized for both printing and on-screen purposes, PhotoZoom Pro 5 is an absolute must-have for anyone who wants to resize images at the highest possible quality.\n\nPhotoZoom Pro 5 - System requirements\n\nWindows:\n\nMicrosoft Windows 8, 7, Vista, XP, 2008, 2003, or 2000\nPentium-compatible processor\n1 GB internal memory\n45 MB free hard disk space\n\nThe PhotoZoom Pro 5 Automation plug-in is compatible with:\nAdobe Photoshop CS6, CS5.5, CS5, CS4 (64-bit and 32-bit)\nAdobe Photoshop CS3, CS2, CS, 7\nAdobe Photoshop Elements 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6\nThe PhotoZoom Pro 5 Export plug-in is compatible with:\nAdobe Photoshop CS6, CS5.5, CS5, CS4 (64-bit and 32-bit)\nAdobe Photoshop CS3, CS2, CS, 7\nAdobe Photoshop Elements 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2\nCorel PaintShop Pro X5, X4\nCorel PaintShop Photo Pro X3\nCorel Paint Shop Pro Photo X2, XI\nCorel Paint Shop Pro X\nCorel PHOTO-PAINT X6 (64-bit and 32-bit)\nCorel PHOTO-PAINT X5, X4, X3\nand should also work with other programs that are compatible with Adobe Photoshop plug-ins\n\nHomepage: http://www.benvista.com/\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n- Install program\n- Register program with given information in key.txt file.\n- Done, Enjoy\n\nHave A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87a59504e5d41b0a52d6bde1bc3d134956086478","amp;dn":"BenVista+PhotoZoom+Pro+v5.0.4+with+Key+%5BTorDigger%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87a59504e5d41b0a52d6bde1bc3d134956086478","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,165,149,4,229,212,27,10,82,214,189,225,188,61,19,73,86,8,100,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
