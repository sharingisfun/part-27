The\nbook describes a method that explicitly recognises the necessity of\nthe patient being actively involved in the treatment. The book has\nbeen glowingly reviewed in all the peak medical journals as well as\nmassage, shiatsu, chiropractic, Pilates, and complementary medical\njournals.\n\nThe book was featured in three separate stories on A Current Affair,\nand this very favourable exposure led to the creation of the national\nOvercome neck &amp; back pain workshops. The Overcome neck &amp; back pain\nsystem is used successfully by many practitioners around the country,\nincluding doctors, chiropractors and osteopaths, massage and other\nbody work therapists: you will see one of our Certificates of\nAttendance on the wall of their clinics if they have done one of our\nintensive workshops.\n\nThe book Overcome neck &amp; back pain (and associated DVDs and CDs)\npresents a comprehensive self-help exercise-based approach to treating\nthese problems.\n\nChapter 1, Self-diagnosis, tells you how to determine whether there is\na structural cause of your problem and corrections for its\ntreatment. It includes a comprehensive set of testing exercises to\nhelp you determine whether muscular imbalance is one of the causes of\nthe problem. The explanation of the testing procedure is detailed but\nassumes that the reader has no prior knowledge of the area: it is\nwritten for you. Another way to find the exercises you need is to use\nthe Where am I sore? illustrations at the end of the chapter.\n\nChapter 2 discusses what stretching really is, and the processes involved.\n\nChapter 3 presents the solo lower back and hip exercises, 1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ10.\n\nChapter 4 presents partner-assisted lower back and hip exercises, 11Ã¢â‚¬â€œ16.\n\nChapter 5 presents the middle back exercises, 17Ã¢â‚¬â€œ24.\n\nChapter 6 describes the neck exercises, 25Ã¢â‚¬â€œ32.\n\nChapter 7 offers additional and stronger exercises, 33Ã¢â‚¬â€œ37\n\nChapter 8 focuses on the shoulder, arm and hand exercises, 38Ã¢â‚¬â€œ44.\n\nChapter 9 presents a range of strengthening exercises, 45Ã¢â‚¬â€œ50.\n\nChapter 10 discusses relaxation, and presents the relaxation script,\nKit's approach to acquiring this elusive physical and emotional\nstate. You can order a version of this script already recorded: one\nside of the tape features the script plus Pacific Ocean background\nsound; the other side features the ocean sounds alone.\n\nChapter 10 investigates the causes of neck and back problems and all\nthe latest relevant statistics and essential information from the\nleading medical and other journals will be found there, too. Sciatica\nis considered closely, and the best, completely-new exercises to treat\npiriformis syndrome (a common cause) are presented. Similarly Thoracic\nOutlet Compression Syndrome: if this is your problem (or RSI or\nOccupational Overuse syndrome) you will find the most effective\nscalene and other neck stretching exercises there, too.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb05d9168ffbe761857447ccbc507e7f5d7b480b","amp;dn":"Overcome+Back+and+Neck+Pain+4th+Ed+-+Kit+Laughlin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb05d9168ffbe761857447ccbc507e7f5d7b480b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,5,217,22,143,251,231,97,133,116,71,204,188,80,126,127,93,123,72,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
