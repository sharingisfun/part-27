At NOsegmenT we do not believe in segmenting, segmenting is whereby you record a tv show and   \n    press stop when the adbreak comes on, then encode that, whilst its encoding you press record   \n    to record the next part of the tv show after the commericial break, once the encode for the    \n    1st part is done youupload it to an ftp even when the show is still airing and do this for     \n    each segment of the show thenrun a script to merge the .avi's together into 1. This often      \n    results in shows going out of sync aftercommercial breaks, which happens quite often. Also you \n    have to predict how long each section of theshow will be e.g 9mins for segment 1, 13mins for   \n    segment 2 and then choose a filsize e.g 70mb forsection 1 and 104mb for section 2. You need to \n    know the length before hand in order to choose the correct filesize, otherwise you may have    \n    some sections with 650 bitrate and others with 1050 which is uneven and ruins caps. Shows      \n    arent always the same length each week and 1-off shows are impossible to predict. For these    \n    reasons we do not segment as this is an evil thing, we believe in quality over speed.          \n                                                                                                   \n    For more information about segmenting check google.                                            \n                                                                                                   \n 2.
