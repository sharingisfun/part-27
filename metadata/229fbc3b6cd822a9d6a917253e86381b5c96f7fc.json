The version released in the United Kingdom (on 8 December 1967) was a six-track double EP, whilst in the United States, the record (released 11 days earlier on 27 November 1967) was an 11-track LP, created by adding songs from the band's 1967 singles. The 11-track LP was later adopted as the official version of the record when The Beatles' catalogue was updated for the CD format.\nThe soundtrack was a critical and commercial success, being Grammy-nominated and a number-one album in the US, despite the relative critical and commercial failure of the Magical Mystery Tour film.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:229fbc3b6cd822a9d6a917253e86381b5c96f7fc","amp;dn":"9%2F14+Magical+Mystery+Tour+%282009+Stereo+Remaster%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"229fbc3b6cd822a9d6a917253e86381b5c96f7fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,159,188,59,108,216,34,169,214,169,23,37,62,134,56,27,92,150,247,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
