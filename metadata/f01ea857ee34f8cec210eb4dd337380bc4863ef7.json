SOMETIMES MYSTERIES ARE NEVER SOLVED. SOMETIMES THERE ARE NO ANSWERS.\n\nDr. Laura Pavlov, an American forensic archaeologist, is about to unravel a mystery that promises to shed light on one of the 20th centuryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest enigmas.\n\nA member of an international team digging on the outskirts of the present-day Russian city of Ekaterinburg, where the Romanov royal family was executed in July 1918, Pavlov discovers a body perfectly preserved in the permafrost of a disused mine shaft.\n\nThe remains offer dramatic new clues to the disappearance of the Romanovs, and in particular their famous daughter, Princess Anastasia, whose murder has always been in question. PavlovÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s discovery sets her on an unlikely journey to Ireland, where a carefully hidden account of a years-old covert mission is about to change the accepted course of world history and hurl her back into the pastÃ¢â‚¬â€into a maelstrom of deceit, secrets, and lies.\nDrawn from historical fact, The Romanov Conspiracy is a high-tension story of love and friendship tested by war, and a desperate battle between revenge and redemption, set against one of the most bloody and brutal revolutions in world history.\n\n\n                             Format 1 - .ePUB\n         \n                             Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n               Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                   &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f01ea857ee34f8cec210eb4dd337380bc4863ef7","amp;dn":"The+Romanov+Conspiracy+by+Glenn+Meade","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f01ea857ee34f8cec210eb4dd337380bc4863ef7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,30,168,87,238,52,248,206,194,16,235,77,211,55,56,11,196,134,62,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
