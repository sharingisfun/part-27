And tomorrow will mark the 50th anniversary of the first conspiracy theories about the assassination of President Kennedy. This was the first traumatic national event to be played out on TV, but this generation would live through several more shootings in the TV ageÃ¢â‚¬â€including MLK in Memphis, RFK in Los Angeles, and JR on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dallas.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nYesterday, Democrats decided to take control of the Senate... several years after winning control of the Senate. Democrats in the Senate voted to end the filibuster! No longer does the Senate need 60 votes out of 100 to do anything. This isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just a triumph for democracy, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a triumph for basic math! Republicans accused the Democrats of a power grab. RightÃ¢â‚¬â€they were finally grabbing the power that they won in the election. Republicans said that the Democrats were trampling the rights of the minority. No. For years now, the Republicans have been trampling the rights of the majority.\n\nThe bottom line is that Mitch McConnell overplayed his hand. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not hard to do when you have a losing hand. Mitch said Ã¢â‚¬Å“I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll regret this. And you may regret it a lot sooner than you think.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Mitch, the last thing you should have done is to issue another one of your threats. It just underscored the fact that all of your threats are now completely empty.\n\nGeorge ZimmermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s estranged wife Shelly is speaking out. Shellie told Katie Couric that George Ã¢â‚¬Å“does seem like a ticking time bomb.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Yes he doesÃ¢â‚¬â€and everybody in Florida feels like weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re living in an episode of Ã¢â‚¬Å“McGyverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the part where the time bomb is only a few seconds from detonating.\n\nFox News has an important message to people this holiday seasonÃ¢â‚¬â€do not give to the poor. John Stossel went out and panhandled and then told viewers not to give money to the poor. My advice to people is simply not to give money to John Stossel. Fox always hypes the so-called Ã¢â‚¬Å“war on Christmas.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ It seems that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re declared a war on the spirit of Christmas. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like Jesus saidÃ¢â‚¬â€Blessed are the selfish jerks, for they shall hang on to their pocket change.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49dc66b1d888af9726971ef22c1fefd8934d9371","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+November+22+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49dc66b1d888af9726971ef22c1fefd8934d9371","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,220,102,177,216,136,175,151,38,151,30,242,44,31,239,216,147,77,147,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
