Public opinion will then confuse in its conception this category of crime with the disgrace attaching to every other and will brand it with the same contempt.&quot;\nProtocol 19 of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.\n\n&quot;If I am killing a rat with a stick and have him in a corner, I am not indignant if he tries to bite me and squeals and gibbers with rage. My job is, not to get angry, but to keep cool, to attend to my footwork and to keep on hitting him where it will do the most good.&quot;\n\n- A. S. Leese, speaking at Reception, 17th Feb., 1937, on his return from prison. \n\nCONTENTS\nChapter. Page\nINTRODUCTION - - - - - - - - 00\n1. HUMAN SACRIFICE A SEMITIC TRADITION - - - - - 1\n2.
