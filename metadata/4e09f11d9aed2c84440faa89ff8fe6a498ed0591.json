Dixon has always managed to find time away from the studio to work as a performer, slapping his upright bass and singing his own tunes in a highly compelling, conversational baritone. He was working the coffeehouse circuit with pianist Memphis Slim when he cut this, his first album as a leader, in 1959. Besides his unique interpretations of &quot;Nervous&quot; and &quot;Built for Comfort,&quot; it includes eight lesser-known compositions from Dixon's prolific pen. It is unlike all other albums by Dixon, as he and Slim are accompanied not by the usual crew of Chicago blues players, but by a group of New York mainstream jazzmen, including tenor saxophonist Hal Ashby and guitarist Wally Richardson.\n\n\nTracklisting:\n\nAll Tracks written by Willie Dixon except as indicated\n\nA1 - Nervous\nA2 - Good Understanding\nA3 - That's My Baby\nA4 - Slim's Thing (*)\nA5 - That's All I Want Baby\nA6 - Don't You Tell Nobody\nA7 - Youth To You\n\nB1 - Sittin' And Cryin' The Blues\nB2 - Built For Comfort\nB3 - I Got A Razor\nB4 - Go Easy (*)\nB5 - Move me\n\n(*) Written by by Peter Chatman (aka Memphis Slim)\n\n\nPersonnel:\n\nBass, Vocals - Willie Dixon\nDrums - Gus Johnson\nGuitar - Wally Richardson\nPiano - Memphis Slim\nSaxophone [Tenor] - Al Ashby\nRecorded By - Rudy Van Gelder\n\n\nTechnical Information:\n\nMusic Hall MMF 5.1 Turntable\nGoldring 1042GX reference Cartridge\nBelari VP-129 Tube Phono PreAmp with Sylvania 12AX7WA\nTascam US-144 external USB 2.0 Audiointerface\nInterconnections by &quot;Goldkabel&quot;\nWavelab 5 recording software\n\nTT &gt; Belari &gt; Laptop &gt; Wavelab 5.01 (24/96) &gt; DeClick 3.01 (Declick 10, Wave, reverse) &gt; analyze &gt;\nsplit into individual Tracks &gt; FLAC encoded (Vers. 1.21)\n\nNo silence been removed, please burn gapless to match original tracklayout.\n\n\nMANY THX TO THE ORIGINAL RELEASER","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e09f11d9aed2c84440faa89ff8fe6a498ed0591","amp;dn":"Willie+Dixon+%26+Memphis+Slim-Willie%5C%27s+Blues%281959%29%5BVinyl+Rip-FL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e09f11d9aed2c84440faa89ff8fe6a498ed0591","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,9,241,29,154,237,44,132,68,15,170,137,255,143,230,164,152,237,5,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
