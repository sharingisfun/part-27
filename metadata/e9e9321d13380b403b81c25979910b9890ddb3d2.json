We can all learn from reading this clear statement from a real expert.\\'--George P. Shultz, former Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury, distinguished fellow at Stanford University\\'s Hoover Institution, former president of Bechtel\n\n\\'My friend Amory Lovins knows that the most important question of the twenty-first century is the \\'how\\' question-how we turn good ideas into working solutions. Reinventing Fire is a wise, detailed, and comprehensive blueprint for gathering the best existing technologies for energy use and putting them to work right now to create jobs, end our dependence on climate-changing fossil fuels, and unleash the enormous economic potential of the coming energy revolution.\\'--President Bill Clinton\n\n\\'If you wanted to bring America happiness and prosperity, and address unemployment, government gridlock and climate change, and create meaning in a world rife with contradictory views and ideologies, you can do one thing: read Reinventing Fire...and then see to it that it is read by every decision maker in the land. This is a stunning work of enormous dimension. Reinventing Fire outlines an eminently practical path to a durable and meaningful future by reimagining how we use and produce the lifeblood of civilization-energy in its myriad forms.\\'--Paul Hawken, author of Blessed Unrest; co-author, Natural Capitalism\n\n\\'Amory Lovins and his team of extraordinary professionals provide an analytically sound, detailed, compelling plan for transforming our national use of energy-and for saving $5 trillion in the process! Reinventing Fire is a towering work, a page-turning tour de force of compelling wisdom that deserves a permanent place on the desk-nay, in the mind-of whoever holds the chair in the Oval Office.\\'--Robert C.
