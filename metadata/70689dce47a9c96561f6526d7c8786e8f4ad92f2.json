Don't complaint and do not PM me asking for high speed seeding, what you see is what you get! It may take sometimes for the torrent to complete, but my computer runnin' 365 days 24/7!... Enjoy!\n\nNow y'all, when you're done please help me seed, i don't have much bandwidth &amp; cannot seed for long, so PLEASE HELP ME SEED, Thanks y'all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70689dce47a9c96561f6526d7c8786e8f4ad92f2","amp;dn":"Notting+Hill+-+Ultimate+Edition+%282+Discs%29+NTSC+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70689dce47a9c96561f6526d7c8786e8f4ad92f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,104,157,206,71,169,201,101,97,246,82,109,124,135,134,232,244,173,146,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
