In the hills surrounding a small, anonymous prairie town, a family band of ex-Confederate bank robbers wait out the posses in search of them. Father Bedloe Mason may understand that his family's time has passed, but to survive, they must steal. His four sons Gray, Frank, Cain, and Wesley do as they're told, but importantly, Bedloe always puts the gang's actions up for a democratic vote...after he carefully sways the consensus among the boys. \n\nOn a nearby farm, ex-Union officer John Willoughby can always be counted on to lend a hand to town marshal, Adam Russell ,to round up renegade Confederates who roam the land, stealing and killing. John's wife, Nora, however, wishes John would stop with this obsession, worrying that it's infected their child, Petey, who hero-worships his father to the point where he wears a pint-sized Union uniform, carries a sword, and calls his father, &quot;Major.&quot; These two families' paths will cross when fatefully, little Petey is accidentally shot dead by jittery Wesley...and when John unknowingly gives aid to wounded Gray.\n\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 419mb\nDuration.... 01:15:04\nCodec.... avc1\nFrame Width..... 560\nFrame Height.... 416\nData Rate.... 651kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 125kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d45cf2e404717ce7b86497a61264cfda8605f23c","amp;dn":"Rebel+in+Town+1956+DvdRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d45cf2e404717ce7b86497a61264cfda8605f23c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,92,242,228,4,113,124,231,184,100,151,166,18,100,207,218,134,5,242,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
