At long last, fans both old and new can enjoy Gary LarsonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Tales From The Far Side and Tales From The Far Side II films together on one DVD! \n\nGary LarsonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Tales From The Far Side and Tales From The Far Side II take you on a journey through the unique landscape of the comically scientific and strangely ironic musings of the ever-so-slightly twisted mind of Gary Larson, the creator of the renowned syndicated cartoon The Far SideÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®. \n\nA 22-minute version of the award-winning Tales From The Far Side debuted as a Halloween special on CBS in 1994 and then disappeared while Larson worked on the sequel. The 45-minute Tales II was completed in 1997. An official selection for numerous film festivals and broadcast in the U.K. on BBC, Tales II was never seen on U.S. television. In 1999, Larson himself re-edited the full (30-minute) version of Tales I and, until now, both films have been available only on VHS. Both films are a collection of animated vignettes created almost exclusively by hand (drawn, inked, and painted) in traditional cel animation technique by the talented artists and animators at International Rocketship, a Canadian animation studio under the direction of Marv Newland (Bambi Meets Godzilla). With minor exceptions, these are dialogue-free vignettes (12 in Tales I and 16 in Tales II), segueing from one little world to another and range in duration from several seconds to several minutes. The usual panoply of Far Side charactersÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½cavemen, cowboys, time-travelers, headhunters, insects, amoebae, wolves, gorillas, dinosaurs, hunters, beer-guzzling aliens, insolent cats, mad farmer scientists, and, of course, cowsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½are all here. ItÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s The Far Side weÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½re already familiar with, alternately funny, bizarre, baffling, and at times poignant. Only now, things are moving. \n\nBoth films feature original musical compositions by GrammyÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® award-winning guitarist Bill Frisell, whose talent provides the musical voice to LarsonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s paradoxical and incongruous humor. The LA Weekly says ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½It fits that Bill Frisell would produce the most personal, emotionally evocative music of his career to-date for a set of compositions inspired by the comic strip The Far Side.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ \n\n\n\nTales I: Gary Larson, Writer/Creator; Marv Newland, Director (original version); Toni Carmichael, Exec.
