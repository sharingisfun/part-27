Diddley's raunchy, distorted 1950s sound and African-derived rhythm have been an enormous influence on pop and rock, from contemporaries like Buddy Holly (whose classic &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; is a de-facto Bo Diddley song) to blues wiseguy George Thorogood, whose remake of Bo's &quot;Bad to the Bone&quot; is being heard somewhere in a movie or a TV commercial even as you read this. Diddley lived and rocked into the 21st century before dying of heart failure in 2008.\n\nBO DIDDLEY\n\n\nDisc 1\n1. Bo Diddley \n2. I'm A Man \n3. Bring It To Jerome \n4. Before You Accuse Me \n5.
