If you deal with percentages in any way then this app will make your life easier.\n\nPercent Calculator comes with EIGHT percentage tools:\n\n1. Find the percent of a number\nUse this option to find the percentage of a value. For example, what is 17.5% of 199.99? Answer is 35\n\n2. Find the percent of a part value\nFor example, what percentage is 55 of 200? Answer = 27.50%\n\n3. Find the percentage change from one value to another\nFor example, If an item originally cost 19.99 and now costs 17.99, by what percent has the price changed? Answer = 10.01%\n\n4. Calculate the value that y% is of value x\nFor example, 245 if 15% of what value? Answer = 1633.33\n\n5. Increase a number by a percentage\nFor example, what is 239 + 7%? Answer = 255.73\n\n6. Decrease a number by a percentage\nFor example, what is 47.00 less 15%? Answer = 39.95\n\n7. Calculate the original value after a percentage was deducted\nFor example, If you have an item that costs 140.00 and this was after a 30% deduction, what was the original price before the deduction? Answer = 200.00\n\n8. Calculate the original value after a percentage was added\nFor example, If an item costs 19.99 including tax at 17.5%, what does the item cost excluding tax? Answer = 17.01\n\nOTHER FEATURES:\n\n* Large easy to see numbers\n* Clear and easy explanation of the answer\n* Learn mode (Clearly explains how the calculation was made and the formula)\n* Reverse inputs (tap the swap button to swap the input values around)\n* User definable number of decimal places\n* International Number formatting with large number separators\n* Copy the answer to either input value or to the clipboard\n\n\nLANGUAGES SUPPORTED:\n\nEnglish, French\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nIntel Mac, OS X.6 or greater\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2791e635128ea6fe954a2aefdafedc727c4a92cd","amp;dn":"Percent+Calculator+v.1.0+%5BK%5Dracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2791e635128ea6fe954a2aefdafedc727c4a92cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,145,230,53,18,142,166,254,149,74,42,239,218,254,220,114,124,74,146,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
