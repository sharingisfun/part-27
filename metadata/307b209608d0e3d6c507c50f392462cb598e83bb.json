However, the hip hop collective The Ummah (composed of Q-Tip, J Dilla, and Ali Shaheed Muhammad) contest that they are the actual producers of the track. In an interview, J Dilla himself stated that he, Q-Tip, and Muhammad produced the original after Jackson met Q-Tip on the set of the 1993 film Poetic Justice. In a story published with Pitchfork, writer Nate Patrin commented on the production of the song, saying the song &quot;bears all the hallmarks of The Ummah style: neo-soul electric pianos, subdued kicks paired with prominent snares, and bass that burbles so thickly that it flows instead of pops&quot;. J Dilla made a remix of the song titled &quot;Got Til' Its Gone (Jay Dee's Revenge Remix)&quot; where Patrin claims J Dilla was the actual producer saying &quot;The revenge in question, then, is simply a matter of cranking up those aforementioned trademarks until the source is unmistakable. The bassline congeals, the keyboards are run through a rippling wah-wah, the titular Joni Mitchell loop fades in and out of focus-- it's the difference between a neon sign and a lava lamp&quot;.\n\n320kbps, comes with Artwork Id3 tags ect.\n\nPlz seeeeeed :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:307b209608d0e3d6c507c50f392462cb598e83bb","amp;dn":"Got+%5C%27Til+It%5C%27s+Gone+%28Ummah+Jay+Dee%5C%27s+Revenge+Mix%29+-+Single","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"307b209608d0e3d6c507c50f392462cb598e83bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,123,32,150,8,208,227,214,197,7,197,15,57,36,98,203,89,142,131,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
