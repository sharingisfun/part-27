Within one hour of gameplay players will course through four decades of contention, paranoia, secrecy, and the overarching us vs. them mentality.\n\nDespite the complex themes encapsulated in TCWE's hour-long gameplay, Alina Digital's mission is to minimize clicks per minute to maximize fun. The challenge in TCWE comes from a live opponent, not figuring out complex game controls.\n\nHow to play:\n1) Run TCWESetupV103.exe and install the game;\n2) Extract Crack.zip archive to where you installed the game (overwrite the original file);\n3) Start the game using main executable or shorcuts.\n\n!
