So they band together, and a daring husband-hunting scheme is born.\n\nIt happened at the ball...\n\nWhere beautiful but bold Lillian Bowman quickly learned that her independent American ways weren't entirely &quot;the thing.&quot; And the most disapproving of all was insufferable, snobbish, and impossible Marcus, Lord Westcliff, London's most eligible aristocrat.\n\nIt happened in the garden...\n\nWhen Marcus shockinglyÃ¢â‚¬â€and dangerouslyÃ¢â‚¬â€swept her into his arms. Lillian was overcome with a consuming passion for a man she didn't even like. Time stood still; it was as if no one else existed...thank goodness they weren't caught very nearly in the act!\n\nIt happened one autumn...\n\nMarcus was a man in charge of his own emotions, a bedrock of stability. But with Lillian, every touch was exquisite torture, every kiss an enticement for more. Yet how could he consider taking a woman so blatantly unsuitable...as his bride","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8d1b4206b1e84b669a551a62b2ef9373762d4c5","amp;dn":"WF02+It+Happened+One+Autumn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8d1b4206b1e84b669a551a62b2ef9373762d4c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,209,180,32,107,30,132,182,105,165,81,166,43,46,249,55,55,98,212,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
