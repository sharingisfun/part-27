On Yalda's world, plants make food by emitting their  own light into the dark night sky. As a child, Yalda witnesses one of a  series of strange meteors, the Hurtlers, that are entering the planetary  system at an immense, unprecedented speed. It becomes apparent that her  world is in imminent danger - and the task of dealing with the Hurtlers  will require knowledge and technology far beyond anything her  civilization has yet achieved! Only one solution seems tenable: if a  spacecraft can be sent on a journey at sufficiently high speed, its trip  will last many generations for those on board, but it will return after  just a few years have passed at home. The travelers will have a chance  to discover the science their planet urgently needs, and bring it back  in time to avert disaster.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f65a2f9c74215d8d8d359ed6f38531c32eed1838","amp;dn":"The+Clockwork+Rocket+by+Greg+Egan+-+Orthogonal+01+-+multi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f65a2f9c74215d8d8d359ed6f38531c32eed1838","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,90,47,156,116,33,93,141,141,53,158,214,243,133,49,195,46,237,24,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
