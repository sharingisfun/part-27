With stellar support form Tony Rice (acoustic guitar), Albert Lee (mandolin), and Ricky Skaggs (fiddle), Harris wanders comfortably and warmly through traditional-country and bluegrass pastures. Skaggs, Dolly Parton, and the Whites add beautiful harmonies as Harris slides effortlessly from the Carter Family to the Stanley Brothers to the Louvin Brothers to Paul Simon. Among the set's peaks are Flatt and Scruggs's 'I'll Go Stepping Too,' with Rice, Skaggs, Lee (on superb electric guitar), and dobro master Jerry Douglas turning up the instrumental heat, and the spiritual 'Jordan,' with Harris, Skaggs, Rice, and Johnny Cash engaging in buoyant four-part harmonies. \n(Marc Greilsamer, amazon.com)\n\n- - -\n\nEmmylou Harris - Roses in the Snow 1980\n(Warner Brothers )\n\n 1.
