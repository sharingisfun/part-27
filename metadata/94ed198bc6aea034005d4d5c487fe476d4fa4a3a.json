Drawing on the stories and novels of writers from around the globeÃ¢â‚¬â€Borges, Bierce, CÃƒÂ©line, CortÃƒÂ¡zar, Faulkner, Kafka, Robbe-GrilletÃ¢â‚¬â€he lays bare the inner workings of fiction, all the while urging young novelists not to lose touch with the elemental urge to create. Conversational, eloquent, and effortlessly erudite, this little book is destined to be read and re-read by young writers, old writers, would-be writers, and all those with a stake in the world of letters.\n\nThis not withstanding, the effect that his masterful work conveys is one of sheer delight in the craft of writing. While Rilke assumes the responsibility of a big brother to his friend, the aspiring writer, Vargas Llosa's tone is much more technical in scope. Letters to a Young Novelist wastes no time in dwelling on questions of time and narrative, levels of reality and overall narrative structure and how these are ultimately understood and used by writers. The author begins the work with a discussion of the nature of literary vocation. He suggests that literary vocation must be worked at, even though he also concedes that writers are not made but rather born. He points out that talent or what some people call genius is not ready-made, but rather only begins to manifest itself after many arduous years of discipline and perseverance. He argues that, for this reason, those who approach literature like they would religion -- with total dedication -- develop the capacity to transcend themselves through their work.\n\nVargas Llosa calls the desire to write, &quot;a basic questioning of reality.&quot; Convinced that people who are satisfied with reality do not desire to write, he then proceeds to decipher the inner world of the writer. Writers, he argues, are essentially architects who scrutinize the logos of the universe while simultaneously organizing and constructing reality with the power of the written word. He goes on to say that this process of discovery only reaffirms the conviction of most writers that writing is the only authentic mode of life for them.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following book:\n\n* Letters to a Young Novelist - Mario Vargas Llosa, translated by Natasha Wimmer -- ePUB\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the following, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.januarymagazine.com/artcult/lettersyoungwriter.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.januarymagazine.com/artcult/lettersyoungwriter.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://southerncrossreview.org/49/matherne-vargas.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://southerncrossreview.org/49/matherne-vargas.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.complete-review.com/reviews/vargas/letteryn.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.complete-review.com/reviews/vargas/letteryn.htm&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94ed198bc6aea034005d4d5c487fe476d4fa4a3a","amp;dn":"Letters+to+a+Young+Novelist+-+Mario+Vargas+Llosa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94ed198bc6aea034005d4d5c487fe476d4fa4a3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,237,25,139,198,174,160,52,0,93,77,92,72,127,228,118,212,250,74,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
