Many critics consider Enter The Wu-Tang one of the most significant albums of the 1990s and one of the greatest hip hop albums recorded.[1][2] The distinctive sound of Enter the Wu-Tang created a blueprint for hardcore hip hop in the mid-1990s and helped return New York City hip hop to national prominence.[3] The Wu-Tang Clan&amp;#039;s debut was a landmark album in an era known as the East Coast Renaissance.[4] The group&amp;#039;s leader, RZA, produced the album with heavy, eerie beats, largely based on martial-arts movie clips and soul music samples. The album is named after the 1978 martial arts film The 36th Chamber of Shaolin.\n\nThe unique sound of Enter the Wu-Tang became hugely influential in modern hip hop production.[5] The album also marked the first appearance of a number of rappersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including Method Man, Ol&amp;#039; Dirty Bastard, Ghostface Killah, and RaekwonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½who have collectively sold millions of solo records. The lyrics of Enter the Wu-Tang are explicit, humorous, and free-associative, and served as a template for many subsequent hip hop records.[6] The Source declared that the first two singles from Enter the Wu-Tang, &quot;Protect Ya Neck&quot; and &quot;C.R.E.A.M.&quot;, are among the 100 Best Rap Singles yet released.[2] Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) had surprising chart success, despite its raw, underground sound.[7] Its highest Billboard 200 chart ranking was number 41, and by May 15, 1995, it was certified platinum in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America.[8][9] The style and success of Enter the Wu-Tang became influential as it helped lead the way for such East Coast rap artists as Nas, The Notorious B.I.G., Mobb Deep, and Jay-Z.[3] In 2003, the album was ranked number 386 on Rolling Stone magazine&amp;#039;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.[10]\n\n\nEnjoy! \n\n\nPlease comment","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a8254a324280ebc0e758b234415e3c10611db65","amp;dn":"Wu-Tang+Clan+-+Enter+The+Wu-Tang+%5B36+Chambers%5D+%5BTRIXINA%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a8254a324280ebc0e758b234415e3c10611db65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,130,84,163,36,40,14,188,14,117,139,35,68,21,227,193,6,17,219,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
