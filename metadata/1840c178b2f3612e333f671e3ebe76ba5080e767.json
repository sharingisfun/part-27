Continuing on the Jawbreaker tradition of poetic lyrics that provide a mental image to each song, the band deals with their endeavors through music instead of wallowing in them, making this record not entirely bleak. &quot;Do You Still Hate Me,&quot; for example, has the persona dishing out the friction of a relationship gone sour through talking to the person in question: &quot;I wrote you a letter/I heard it upset you/How can I do this better/We're getting older/But we're acting younger.&quot; Being critiqued and ostracized from their scene during the height of their popularity was another headache singer/songwriter Blake Schwarzenbach dealt with around the time this album was released (their previous album, Bivouac, provided them with a huge cult following). This no doubt inspired the song &quot;Indictment,&quot; which talks about not caring what anyone thinks of their songwriting (&quot;I just wrote the dumbest song/It's going to be a singalong/Our enemies will laugh and be pointing/It wont bother me, what the thoughtless are thinking&quot;). Providing the perfect flow of temperamental pop to go along with these stories is proof enough that 24 Hour Revenge Therapy is the pivot of Jawbreaker's creative output. \n\n\nFormat: CD\nReleased: 1993\nLabel: Tupelo\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie Rock, Punk\nQuality: FLAC\nAllmusic rating: 4 / 5 stars\n\nTracks:\n\n   1. &quot;The Boat Dreams from the Hill&quot;  2:39\n   2. &quot;Indictment&quot;                     2:49\n   3. &quot;Boxcar&quot;                         1:54\n   4. &quot;Outpatient&quot;                     3:41\n   5. &quot;Ashtray Monument&quot;               3:04\n   6. &quot;Condition Oakland&quot;              5:17\n   7. &quot;Ache&quot;                           4:14\n   8. &quot;Do You Still Hate Me?&quot;          2:52\n   9. &quot;West Bay Invitational&quot;          3:58\n  10. &quot;Jinx Removing&quot;                  3:13\n  11. &quot;In Sadding Around&quot;              3:54","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1840c178b2f3612e333f671e3ebe76ba5080e767","amp;dn":"Jawbreaker+-+24+Hour+Revenge+Therapy+%281993%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1840c178b2f3612e333f671e3ebe76ba5080e767","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,64,193,120,178,243,97,46,51,63,103,30,62,190,118,186,80,128,231,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
