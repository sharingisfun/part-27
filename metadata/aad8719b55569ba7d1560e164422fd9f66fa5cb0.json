In 1987 he moved to the Silicon Valley region of Northern California and joined Parallax, a startup video card company with about 40 employees. Disliking the company's culture and his colleagues (&quot;The people I met were like Stepford Wives. They were true believers in something, and I don't know what it was&quot;), Judge quit after less than three months, but the experience gave him the background to later create a show about the region's people and companies.\n\nFilming for the pilot of Silicon Valley began on March 12, 2013, in Palo Alto, California.[1] HBO green-lit the series on May 16, 2013.[5]\n\nCast[edit]\nMain[edit]\nThomas Middleditch as Richard Hendrix[6], a developer who, while working on his music-matching website called Pied Piper, manages to create a lossless compression algorithm that could revolutionize the industry.\nT.
