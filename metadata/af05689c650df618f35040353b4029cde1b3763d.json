In order for sharing on the internet and namelya video was created to sync perfectly with the great visual elements Feed Me brings to his live performances. For those who hadn't been to his concerts, this could be a likely supplement though it really is nothing close to the true experience. Others like myself might have been desperately clinging to reality by the time his set came up and this video could help bring back some nostalgia.
