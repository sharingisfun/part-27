I&amp;#039;ve tested this pretty well and it works with settings from the previous version I posted (http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3716207)\n\nIf it doesn&amp;#039;t work post the info.\n\n\n----------------------\n[comments from 9.0.0.0\n\nThis version of Directory Opus 9 (DOpus) really does work. No crack needed as there&amp;#039;s a licence included. Do *NOT* update this (don&amp;#039;t allow it to connect to the Internet) or it may stop the program working.\n\nAdd the certificate (text file) certificate by browsing to the file via the LOAD button in Licence menu. Make sure you completely remove any newer version by going into Program Folders/ and remove the &quot;GPSoft&quot; folder.\n\nVersion 9+ works in XP or Vista. \n\nKeep seeding when you&amp;#039;ve downloaded it and if you find a newer version share it.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:861756c4d6ce410501a1930a41ba5144f87edd33","amp;dn":"Directory+Opus+9.0.0.6+%5BWindows+Explorer+alternative%5D+DOpus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"861756c4d6ce410501a1930a41ba5144f87edd33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,23,86,196,214,206,65,5,1,161,147,10,65,186,81,68,248,126,221,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
