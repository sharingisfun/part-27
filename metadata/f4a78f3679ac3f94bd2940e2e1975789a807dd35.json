After experimenting with Eastern psychedelic ragas on his last record 'Raag Manifestos', he now travels back towards something more traditional and altogether more rewarding. 'Kensington Blues' is probably the most accomplished of all Rose's records and contains eight tracks ranging from folk to ragtime played on his trusty 12-string guitar. The title track is easily the most accessible of this collection, and utilises his obvious skill to craft a song drenched in the most perfect guitar melodies this side of John Fahey. The aforementioned Fahey (quite clearly a gigantic influence on Mr. Rose) pops up on the album too, as 'Sunflower River Blues' is a cover of one of his tracks, and even this (which could easily be sacrilegious) comes across beautifully. This album comes with a hearty recommendation, anyone who has been poking around the recent Revenant reissues (American Primitive volumes I&amp;II) should give this a spin straight away. Rose is the natural successor to the throne of acoustic blues, and this record is a thoroughly regal listening experience....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4a78f3679ac3f94bd2940e2e1975789a807dd35","amp;dn":"Jack+Rose+-+Kensington+Blues+%5B2005%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4a78f3679ac3f94bd2940e2e1975789a807dd35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,167,143,54,121,172,63,148,189,41,64,226,225,151,87,137,168,7,221,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
