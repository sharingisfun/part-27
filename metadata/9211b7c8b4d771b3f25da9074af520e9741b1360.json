Formed in Omaha, Nebraska, the band consists of Todd Fink, Jacob Thiele, Dapose, Joel Petersen and Clark Baechle. The Faint was originally known as Norman Bailer and included Conor Oberst (of Bright Eyes, with whom the Faint toured in 2005). He quit shortly after the band was formed,[1] though the Faint continued to share a spot with Bright Eyes on Saddle Creek Records.\n\nGrowing up, Fink, Petersen, and Baechle skateboarded in their free time until Fink developed knee problems, which shifted their hobbies towards making music.[2] The band originally consisted of Clark Baechle, Todd Fink (formerly Todd Baechle), and Joel Petersen. They signed to Saddle Creek Records and released a few singles, but were unable to establish widespread sales. After adding Matt Bowen, the Faint released Media. While touring, Bowen left and was replaced by Jacob Thiele. The next album, Blank-Wave Arcade, had a more dance and techno influenced sound and was an underground hit.[3] Partway through the creation of Danse Macabre, the Faint added Dapose, a death metal guitarist formerly of LEAD. Their next album, released in 2004, was called Wet from Birth.\n\n   1. &quot;Syntax Lies&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:39\n   2. &quot;Some Incriminating Photographs&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:09\n   3. &quot;As the Doctor Talks&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:16\n   4. &quot;Tandem: City to City&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:13\n   5. &quot;Repertoire of Uncommon Depth&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:42\n   6. &quot;Typing: 1974-2048&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:00\n   7. &quot;Lullaby for the...&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:54\n   8. &quot;Acting: On Campus Television&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:34\n   9. &quot;(GettingGiving the Lock)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:49\n  10. &quot;Amorous in Bauhaus Fashion&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:01\n  11. &quot;There's Something Not As Valid When the Scenery Is a Postcard&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:33\n  12. &quot;An Allusion Passes Through the Bar&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:57\n  13. &quot;Defy the Ailments&quot; (Hidden track) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:05\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Faint#Albums&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Faint#Albums&lt;/a&gt;   Bitrate: 192kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9211b7c8b4d771b3f25da9074af520e9741b1360","amp;dn":"The+Faint+-+Media+%281998%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9211b7c8b4d771b3f25da9074af520e9741b1360","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,17,183,200,180,215,113,179,242,93,169,7,74,245,32,233,116,27,19,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
