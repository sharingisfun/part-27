The performance is a live show from Stockholm recorded on August 21, 1973, with the exception of one track recorded in Sydney in July 1973. The band, featuring Jean-Luc Ponty, George Duke, and Ruth Underwood, is one of Zappa's more jazz-oriented, and the selections, including &quot;Redunzl&quot; and &quot;Dupree's Paradise,&quot; are among Zappa's more involved instrumentals. Sound quality is good.\n\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
