But, to test if they really work, the family are set some tough challenges: to take on pro-cyclists on Sheffield's notorious hills and do the weekly family supermarket shop on two wheels. There are also computers to take over the jobs that humans used to do, from a prototype robot dietician that talks to you as it monitors what you eat and how you exercise, to a computerised version of a personal fitness coach to monitor and map your exercise regime. Super-fit Joel also tests out scientifically designed post-workout suits created to get your body back in shape, promising 50% less fatigue! In the newly-futurised bathroom there's a Ã‚Â£5000 mirror that monitors your health by reading your weight, BMI and body fat percentage (as well as displaying news, weather and social media sites), and a toilet that gives you an intimate 'wash and blow dry'. Meanwhile, the family are on a diet of 'super shakes' - tipped to take off in the next decade as smoothies did in the last one - complete with spirulina, raw cocoa and bee pollen. Can it help diabetic dad Tony control his blood-sugar level? And there are more edible medicals, as the family experiment with Japanese sweets that promise to boost your collagen or even make your breasts grow.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img201/1492/homeofthefuturescreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img201/1492/homeofthefuturescreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img39/246/homeofthefuturescreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img39/246/homeofthefuturescreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img43/6742/homeofthefuturescreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img43/6742/homeofthefuturescreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img171/7097/homeofthefuturescreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img171/7097/homeofthefuturescreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img838/9836/homeofthefuturescreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img838/9836/homeofthefuturescreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img440/4784/homeofthefuturescreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img440/4784/homeofthefuturescreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img714/4631/homeofthefuturescreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img714/4631/homeofthefuturescreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img851/3038/homeofthefuturescreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img851/3038/homeofthefuturescreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img408/149/homeofthefuturescreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img408/149/homeofthefuturescreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1939 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 46.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 5\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Source: PDTV\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9075253/Channel-4s-Home-of-the-Future-welcomes-the-new-age-of-technology.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9075253/Channel-4s-Home-of-the-Future-welcomes-the-new-age-of-technology.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nAdded by &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3AHarry65&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3AHarry65&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSource: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Home_Of_The_Future&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Home_Of_The_Future&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bf1f648202fe03efad1ef3ede28344971dbdd65","amp;dn":"Ch4+Home+Of+The+Future+5of5+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bf1f648202fe03efad1ef3ede28344971dbdd65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,241,246,72,32,47,224,62,250,209,239,62,222,40,52,73,113,219,221,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
