His main target was the Northern Kingdom, yet his message was for the people of God.\n\nWhen Solomon died, Jeroboam rebelled and plunged the Northern Kingdom into a prosperous but idolatrous separation. After two centuries of abandoning their heritage, God sent Hosea to present His indictment and declare that He would use their enemies as His judgment.\n\nAmos was sent to Israel at a time when the nation feels militarily secure and prosperous, yet is turning to idolatry and abandoning their heritage. Misplaced confidence; false sense of security; abandonment of the greatness of their nation... (Sounds familiar, doesn't it?) In many ways a complement to Hosea, this perspective on the plight of Israel parallels the predicament of our country today.\n\nThis study contains 13 hours of verse by verse teachings\n\n\nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, Bless all that Seed Long.\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\n                                             \n\n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n\n  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c015b2a02e78ea87f18562a04a2736bc9f1f1a53","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Chuck+Missler+-+The+Prophets+of+The+Northern+Kingdom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c015b2a02e78ea87f18562a04a2736bc9f1f1a53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,21,178,160,46,120,234,135,241,133,98,160,74,39,54,188,159,31,26,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
