But his arrival in Cambridge disrupts an uneasy status quo as he glimpses a world of privilege and abuse, where the sinister Holy Ghost Club governs life at Jerusalem more effectively than the Master, Dr. Carbury, ever could.\n\nAnd when Holdsworth finds himself hauntedÃ‚â€”not only by the ghost of his dead wife, Maria, but also by Elinor, the very-much-alive MasterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wifeÃ‚â€”his fate is sealed. He must find SylviaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s murderer, or else the hauntings will continue. And not one of this troubled group will leave the claustrophobic confines of Jerusalem unchanged.\n\nCWA Cartier Diamond Dagger winner Andrew Taylor returns with an outstanding historical novel that will simultaneously keep the reader riveted, and enchant with its effortless elegance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:717159bdf92dbba925dcea936b3fb81d55d31d4d","amp;dn":"The+Anatomy+of+Ghosts+-+Andrew+Taylor.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"717159bdf92dbba925dcea936b3fb81d55d31d4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,113,89,189,249,45,187,169,37,220,234,147,107,63,184,29,85,211,29,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
