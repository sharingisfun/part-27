Your way. Your Executive Assistant.\nExecutive Assistant provides an all-in-one interface for quickly reviewing your:\n\n+ Email: any combination of GMail, Google Apps, or POP/IMAP accounts. Exchange too if you use TouchDown, Enhanced Email or K-9. Gmail users: please see note below.\n+ Text messages: both native and Google Voice, including pop-up and reply options\n+ Missed calls: return calls directly from the app\n+ Calendar events (including Exchange &amp; Facebook if supported by your phone)\n+ Tasks: Astrid, Got To Do, GTasks by Dato, ToDo Task Manager (lite or pro), or TouchDown\n+ Google Reader\n+ Twitter timeline\n+ Facebook news\nUse in any of 3 modes:\n+ Lock Screen: Use as a lock screen replacement to preview all of your stuff without going thru the hassle of unlocking the phone. You choose which info is safe to show on the lock screen.\n+ Welcome Screen: Instant-on immediately after unlocking the phone. Don't pattern lock your phone? Give this mode a try for instant access to all your stuff.\n\n+ Home Screen Widget: 'always on' interface wherever you want it. Use a full-widget that includes a preview area, or a single-row, icons-only widget that simply shows the app icons with counts. Many sizes to choose from. Optionally use a Sense-like or Glass theme for the full-widget.\nFull-widgets are scrollable on Honeycomb and for any launcher that supports version 2 of the scrollable widgets extension, such as: ADW, Launcher+, Go and Zeam (but not Launcher Pro since it uses version 1).\nIn every mode: launch apps, return missed calls, dial voicemail (or optionally choose to launch Google Voice, Visual Voicemail or any other voicemail app).\n\nReply to SMS messages directly from the Welcome Screen or Lock Screen, without unlocking (if you enable this option).\nHost your favorite widgets &amp; shortcuts on lock or welcome screen.\nThe background image will be the same as your home screen wallpaper (including live wallpapers). Customize the color and transparency of the text displays in all modes. Optionally select custom icons for the tabs.\nIntegrates with TouchDown by NitroDesk so you can view your corporate email, calendar and tasks in Executive Assistant.\n\n#################\n\nATTENTION GMAIL USERS: in the latest update to the Gmail app (version 2.3.5), Google no longer allows 3rd party apps to access the Gmail app's database. However, you still have two good options for accessing your gmail &amp; Google Apps accounts in Executive Assistant (EA):\n\n1. enable IMAP for your account (from GMail on the web, see Settings/Mail settings/Forwarding &amp; POP/IMAP), then access your account using K9, Enhanced EMail, or the POP/IMAP add-on. We recommend K9 or Enhanced EMail since then EA won't have to fetch your messages separately, and clicking a message in EA will open it in K9 or Enhanced EMail as appropriate\nor,\n\n2. use the &quot;Get from Google&quot; option in EA. In Settings/Configure tabs/EMail/Manage accounts, click on your gmail account, then select &quot;Get from Google&quot; and enter your password.\n\n\nInstallation Notes:\n\n1) Go to settings - applications - enable the 'unknown sources' option.          \n2) Put the .apk files somewhere on your SD card.                                 \n3) Open your file manager on the device (like Astro Manager from market). \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6739487/ASTRO_File_Manager_pro_v3.0_apk_android_[szoheb]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6739487/ASTRO_File_Manager_pro_v3.0_apk_android_[szoheb]&lt;/a&gt;\n                    \n4) Select a .apk file.                                                           \n5) If you get the 'complete action using' pop-up, choose 'package installer'.\n\nScreens :\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/GakBlaADm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/GakBlaADm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease SEED..!! =)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f42611c7b67188bb588cb55bff2700e8879f89cf","amp;dn":"Executive+Assistant%2B+v1.8.2+apk+android+%5Bszoheb%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f42611c7b67188bb588cb55bff2700e8879f89cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,38,17,199,182,113,136,187,88,140,181,91,255,39,0,232,135,159,137,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
