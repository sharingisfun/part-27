History has identified the period \nfollowing the fall of the Roman Empire with a descent into barbarism - a \nterrible time when civilisation stopped. \n\nWaldemar Januszczak disagrees. In this four-part series he argues that the Dark \nAges were a time of great artistic achievement, with new ideas and religions \nprovoking new artistic adventures. He embarks on a fascinating trip across \nEurope, Africa and Asia, visits the world's most famous collections and \ndiscovers hidden artistic gems, all to prove that the Dark Ages were actually \nan 'Age of Light'. \n\nIn the final episode, Waldemar looks towards the north of Europe. The \nCarolingians saw themselves as successors to Rome, reflected in their art. \nElsewhere, the Vikings were constructing long ships with intricate decoration \nand marking their territory with powerful rune stones. And on the British \nIsles, the Irish and Anglo-Saxons were creating unique works of manuscript \nillumination and remarkable jewellery.
