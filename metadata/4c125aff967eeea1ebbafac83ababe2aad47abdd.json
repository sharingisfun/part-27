Taken from the original first-generation masters, apparently for the first time, the sound quality ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with a crispness and definition previously unheard ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and even track selection, is the finest yet. &quot;On the Road Again&quot;\n&quot;Wild About My Lovin',&quot; and &quot;Darlin' Companion,&quot; all excellent tunes representative of the Spoonful's good-time folksy/jugband style that were omitted from the Rhino set, are included, further reinforcing this as the last word in single-disc anthologies from this legendary band. What's startling is how many great songs the group recorded in such a short time span. The majority of the tracks were released within a two-year period from 1965-1967, almost\nall springing from the pen of John Sebastian who also took lead vocals on all the hits. The band was a textbook example of compressed quality, with only three tracks here breaking the three-minute barrier, and many clocking in at just under two. Which means there still could be an even more definitive compilation created by adding five more songs and extending the running time to the 77-minute CD maximum. Until then, this is the Lovin' Spoonful disc to own. \n(AMG) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:avftxqtkldhe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:avftxqtkldhe&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovin%27_Spoonful&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovin%27_Spoonful&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe Lovin' Spoonful - Greatest Hits\nThis compilation 2000\nBuddha Records - digitally remastered\n\n01  The Lovin' Spoonful - Greatest Hits - Do You Believe In Magic\n02  The Lovin' Spoonful - Greatest Hits - You Didn't Have To Be So Nice\n03  The Lovin' Spoonful - Greatest Hits - Daydream\n04  The Lovin' Spoonful - Greatest Hits - You Baby\n05  The Lovin' Spoonful - Greatest Hits - Did You Ever Have To Make Up Your Mind\n06  The Lovin' Spoonful - Greatest Hits - Wild About My Lovin'\n07  The Lovin' Spoonful - Greatest Hits - Younger Girl\n08  The Lovin' Spoonful - Greatest Hits - On The Road Again\n09  The Lovin' Spoonful - Greatest Hits - Didn't Want To Have To Do It\n10  The Lovin' Spoonful - Greatest Hits - Jug Band Music\n11  The Lovin' Spoonful - Greatest Hits - Summer In The City\n12  The Lovin' Spoonful - Greatest Hits - Rain On The Roof\n13  The Lovin' Spoonful - Greatest Hits - Pow (Theme From 'What's Up Tiger Lily?')\n14  The Lovin' Spoonful - Greatest Hits - Nashville Cats\n15  The Lovin' Spoonful - Greatest Hits - Lovin' You\n16  The Lovin' Spoonful - Greatest Hits - Darlin' Companion\n17  The Lovin' Spoonful - Greatest Hits - Coconut Grove\n18  The Lovin' Spoonful - Greatest Hits - Full Measure\n19  The Lovin' Spoonful - Greatest Hits - Darling Be Home Soon\n20  The Lovin' Spoonful - Greatest Hits - Lonely (Amy's Theme)\n21  The Lovin' Spoonful - Greatest Hits - You're A Big Boy Now\n22  The Lovin' Spoonful - Greatest Hits - Six O'Clock\n23  The Lovin' Spoonful - Greatest Hits - She Is Still A Mystery\n24  The Lovin' Spoonful - Greatest Hits - Money\n25  The Lovin' Spoonful - Greatest Hits - Younger Generation\n26  The Lovin' Spoonful - Greatest Hits - Never Going Back","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c125aff967eeea1ebbafac83ababe2aad47abdd","amp;dn":"Lovin%5C%27+Spoonful+-+Greatest+Hits++FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c125aff967eeea1ebbafac83ababe2aad47abdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,18,90,255,150,126,238,161,235,186,250,200,58,186,190,42,173,71,171,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
