This period in Zappa's career is otherwise documented by the album â€œZoot Alluresâ€, and by â€œZappa in New Yorkâ€, drawn from shows recorded two months later.\r\n\r\nThe difference on this release is the addition of vocalist/keyboardist Bianca Odin, also known as Bianca Thornton and Lady Bianca. Her gospel tinged vocals add much to songs like Dirty Love, Chrissy Puked Twice (known to Zappaphiles as T!tt!es &amp; Beer) and of course, Dinah-Moe Humm. \r\nPreviously heard only on one two-minute track Zappa released in the early 90â€™s on â€˜You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore Vol. 6â€™, her flamboyant soul singing is an unusual flavor in Zappaâ€™s music, even helping Zappa replicate some of the salacious groupie banter previously heard during the â€˜Flo &amp; Eddie daysâ€™ of the Mothers.\r\n\r\nAlso appearing for the first time on the album are a cover of &quot;Stranded in the Jungle&quot; (originally recorded in 1956 by the Jay Hawks), and a verse of lyrics in &quot;Titties 'N Beer&quot; not included in previously released versions of the song, which illuminates Zappa's original title for the song, &quot;Chrissy Puked Twice.&quot;\r\n   \r\n\r\nFrank Zappa\r\n\r\nPhilly â€˜76\r\n\r\n(Spectrum, Philadelphia, PA, October 29, 1976)\r\n\r\n2009\r\n\r\n\r\n2CDs / 2009 / VBR-V0\r\n\r\n\r\nDisc 1:\r\n\r\n1.
