While most mods tended to be of the adventure variety, a new type of industrial-style mod started to become mature. Getting a stable game going with the most fleshed-out and popular ones, KakerMix released it as a small modpack on the SA Forums. It managed to gather a few tens of downloads, and one of them was Lewis of Yogscast fame. He did a series on it, suddenly thrusting Technic, the mods it contained and the modders themselves into the faces of millions of new fans. With the sudden exposure and fame, KakerMix started to focus the sudden influence into a tool of good for the community.\n\nTechnic coalesced into a team of people and began to pump out community-altering projects. The Technic website and Forums gave a place for people to discuss things in a respectable way with hard-hitting moderators and at least the illusion of quality control. The Technic Launcher finally hit home the idea that people donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to hand-modify .jar files to play modded Minecraft. Tekkit gave server operators a chance to actually run and play a heavily modded Minecraft server by easily having a standard client to point users to, introduced modded Minecraft to hundreds of thousands of players, and gave thousands of (mostly hopeful) YouTube stars a block of content to play with. Voltz showcased an unheard of team and their creations, giving them a huge bank of eager consumers within a week of itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s launch. More recently the new Technic Launcher and Technic Platform are poised to again streamline down modded Minecraft, and make it seamless for content creators, server operators and players to kick back and play, create, claim and enjoy the game they love with as little hassle as possible.\n\nTechnic as an identity and community has made itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mark on Minecraft, what was once a .zip file is now a multiple-hundred-thousand strong powerhouse of the community. Players, server operators, content creators, map makers and burgeoning YouTube stars now have the Technic Platform to help make Minecraft what they choose it to be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR The Technic Pack cracked so you can use your own name and update.\n\n\n\nSEED IT FOR GOOD KARMA!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:236a9ead616d4ec5be919fc2e3fa8f477b1b0002","amp;dn":"Technic+Launcher+Cracked+EXE+%2B+Update+%7CVakume%7C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"236a9ead616d4ec5be919fc2e3fa8f477b1b0002","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,106,158,173,97,109,78,197,190,145,159,194,227,250,143,71,123,27,0,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
