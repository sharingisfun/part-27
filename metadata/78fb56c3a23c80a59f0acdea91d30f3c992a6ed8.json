Cronyn plays a smooth-talking skid row derelict who befriends wealthy Philadelphia &quot;mainline&quot; kid Fred Savage. Both the old bum and the young preppie have lost faith in themselves and the world but are redeemed by the spirit of Christmas and the bonds of friendship. Made for TV, Christmas on Division Street is saved from being a heaping bowl of Yuletide mush by the ever-iconoclastic Cronyn.
