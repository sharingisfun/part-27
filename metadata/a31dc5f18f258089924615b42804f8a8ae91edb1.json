OR DIE: How To Survive as an Independent Artist&quot; \nFree high-quality iPhone/iPod rips\n\nDVD, and all extras of &quot;D.I.Y. OR DIE: How To Survive as an Independent Artist&quot;. Director Michael W. Dean is giving away the entire film, encoded in high quality (30 fps, 800 kbps mp4 file, 640x480 size, with 128-bit audio, and no DRM). It looks great on an iPod, iPhone, Zune, etc., and damn good full screen on a computer. \n\nSeven extras from the DVD (including interviews with Ian MacKaye, Steve Albini, and Lydia Lunch) are included.\n\nFILM DESCRIPTION:\nThis film is a celebration of the artistic underdog! FEATURING interviews and performances from: Lydia Lunch, Ian MacKaye (Fugazi), J Mascis (Dinosaur jr.), Jim Rose (Jim Rose Sideshow), J.G. Thirlwell (Foetus), Mike Watt (Minutemen), Richard Kern (Filmmaker), Ron Asheton (Stooges), Madigan Shive (Bonfire Madigan), Dave Brockie (Gwar) and more. \n\nDean says, &quot;People keep asking me, &amp;#039;Why are you posting the whole film when it&amp;#039;s still selling well on DVD? Are you CRAZY?&amp;#039;&quot; Dean&amp;#039;s reply (in part): &quot;It&amp;#039;s my gift to the world. People write me every day and tell me the film got them off their ass. I made the film to spread a message, not make money. And somehow, it still made money. That&amp;#039;s how I do things - it&amp;#039;s how I pay my rent on planet earth.&quot; \n\nFilm info: http://www.diyordie.org\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a31dc5f18f258089924615b42804f8a8ae91edb1","amp;dn":"D.I.Y.+OR+DIE%3A+How+To+Survive+as+an+Independent+Artist","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a31dc5f18f258089924615b42804f8a8ae91edb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,29,197,241,143,37,128,137,146,70,21,180,40,4,248,168,174,145,237,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
