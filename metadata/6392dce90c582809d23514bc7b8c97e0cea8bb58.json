The first comprehensive history of these world-famous monsters, The Gargoyles of Notre-Dame argues that they transformed the iconic thirteenth-century cathedral into a modern monument.\n\nMichael Camille begins his long-awaited study by recounting architect EugÃƒÂ¨ne Viollet-le-DucÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ambitious restoration of the structure from 1843 to 1864, when the gargoyles were designed, sculpted by the little-known Victor Pyanet, and installed. These gargoyles, Camille contends, were not mere avatars of the Middle Ages, but rather fresh creationsÃ¢â‚¬â€symbolizing an imagined pastÃ¢â‚¬â€whose modernity lay precisely in their nostalgia. He goes on to map the critical reception and many-layered afterlives of these chimeras, notably in the works of such artists and writers as Charles MÃƒÂ©ryon, Victor Hugo, and photographer Henri Le Secq. Tracing their eventual evolution into icons of high kitsch, Camille ultimately locates the gargoylesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ place in the twentieth-century imagination, exploring interpretations by everyone from Winslow Homer to the Walt Disney Company.\n\nLavishly illustrated with more than three hundred images of its monumental yet whimsical subjects, The Gargoyles of Notre-Dame is a must-read for historians of art and architecture and anyone whose imagination has been sparked by the lovable monsters gazing out over Paris from one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most renowned vantage points.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6392dce90c582809d23514bc7b8c97e0cea8bb58","amp;dn":"The+Gargoyles+of+Notre-Dame%3A+Medievalism+and+the+Monsters+of+Mod","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6392dce90c582809d23514bc7b8c97e0cea8bb58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,146,220,233,12,88,40,9,210,53,20,188,123,140,151,224,206,168,187,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
