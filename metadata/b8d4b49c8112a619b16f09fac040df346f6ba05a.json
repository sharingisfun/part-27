From the surrealism of early video games to raw connections made over primitive newsgroups, from sex bots to Sailor Moon, Alexander intimately captures a dark frontier age.\n\nLeigh Alexander writes about video games, interactive entertainment, and various other things. As longtime editor-at-large for game industry site Gamasutra, she contributes editorial, criticism, trend analysis and interviews with developers. Her monthly column in Edge magazine deals with cultural issues surrounding the business of games and the people who play them. Her column at Kotaku is weirder. In a good way, probably.\n\n----\n\nLeigh Alexander's excellent eBook &quot;Breathing Machine&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8d4b49c8112a619b16f09fac040df346f6ba05a","amp;dn":"Breathing+Machine+-+Leigh+Alexander","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8d4b49c8112a619b16f09fac040df346f6ba05a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,212,180,156,129,18,166,25,177,111,9,250,192,64,223,52,111,107,160,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
