Local experts and everyday folks lead host Brian Unger to insights about some of America's most baffling questions. How are flying fish threatening to re-draw the shape of Illinois? What does the use of cell phones by Pennsylvania's Amish have to do with the shape of their state? How is the phrase sold down the river linked to the shape of what might be the 51st state? Why did the invention of air conditioning change how America picks its Presidents? Unger uncovers the answers, hidden in the map. This is no textbook-style documentary series, each episode finds quirky and fun facts to inform and educate, and the comedic style will appeal perfectly to both older and younger consumers, from students to history buffs. Host Brian Unger is well known for his irreverent YouTube online news programme The Young Turks which is the biggest show of its type in the World.\n\n\n\n\n3)  Force of Nature \nHow have massive geological events helped create the American map? Long before the Founding Fathers drew the map, Mother Nature shaped some states. How did an asteroid create the border for three states and change history? How did glaciers plow the Great Plains and how did natural disasters continue to alter the map?\n\n4)  State of Rebellion \nHow did the most rebellious states took shape? How did they earn their outsized features and outspoken reputations? For instance, why does Montana looks like it took a bite out of Idaho? Why wasn't Texas broken up into five states? And why exactly do we have not one but two Carolinas?\n\n5)  Living on the Edge \nWhat secrets are hiding in our map? What's behind the &quot;blank spots&quot; like Area 51? What possessed the citizens of Key West to throw down their margaritas and secede from Florida? And even in the heartland, there are those living on the edge -- in Kansas, old missile bunkers are now five bedroom dream homes. And what about the county in Georgia that was left off the state's quarter?\n\n6)  Use It or Lose It \nIf you thought our borders were set in stone, you'd be wrong. Who stole a corner of Washington, DC? Is Ohio actually a state? And why isn't St. Louis our nation's capital? One thing's for sure -- our map could look very different. How did we create order out of so much chaos? With the vote.\n\n7)  Church and States \nEver since the Pilgrims boarded the Mayflower, what we believe and how we believe has shaped the American map. Could Utah have been bigger than Texas? How did religion shatter New England into such odd little shapes? And did the Civil War actually begin... in Kansas?\n\n8)  A Boom with a View \nDid money make our map? Through boom and through bust, the sweet smell of profit has drawn and redrawn our states. How did Green Bay help carve our border with Canada? What does football have to do with fur? Is North Carolina the real &quot;Golden State&quot;? And why should we all move to North Dakota?\n\n9)  Culture Clash \nWill rivalries within our states break them into pieces? Cultures compete against each other all over the map. In extreme cases, they can divide states in two. How did World War II preserve the shape of California? Will part of Maine break off and become Northern Massachusetts? And as new cultures move into Florida, will the state's cowboy tradition get pushed off the map?\n\n10)  Mouthing Off \nWe all live in the same country, so why do we sound do different? It's a matter of where you are on the map. Why didn't the southern accent exist until after the Civil War? How did California athletes end up coining so many new words? Why do we have so many different words for the same things -- like pop versus soda? Will one particularly strong accent cause New York to break up and create a 51st state?\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img805.imageshack.us/img805/6051/howthestatesgottheirsha.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img805.imageshack.us/img805/6051/howthestatesgottheirsha.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/2998/howthestatesgottheirshaj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/2998/howthestatesgottheirshaj.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img41.imageshack.us/img41/6051/howthestatesgottheirsha.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img41.imageshack.us/img41/6051/howthestatesgottheirsha.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img221.imageshack.us/img221/6051/howthestatesgottheirsha.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img221.imageshack.us/img221/6051/howthestatesgottheirsha.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/668/howthestatesgottheirshab.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/668/howthestatesgottheirshab.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img22.imageshack.us/img22/6051/howthestatesgottheirsha.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img22.imageshack.us/img22/6051/howthestatesgottheirsha.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img43.imageshack.us/img43/6051/howthestatesgottheirsha.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img43.imageshack.us/img43/6051/howthestatesgottheirsha.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/2117/howthestatesgottheirshaz.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/2117/howthestatesgottheirshaz.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img59.imageshack.us/img59/6051/howthestatesgottheirsha.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img59.imageshack.us/img59/6051/howthestatesgottheirsha.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;fab2939d92bab6c9d4cb&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 2004 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio Codec: AC3\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 Kbps AVR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: 2\n * Run-Time: 40mins\n * Frame rate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 10\n * Part Size: 587 MB\n * Container: mp4\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Source: DVD\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_the_States_Got_Their_Shapes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_the_States_Got_Their_Shapes&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78aa7e2f2f82dfed24d11074c397606515d3f40d","amp;dn":"History+Ch+How+the+States+Got+Their+Shapes+Series+1+03of10+Force","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78aa7e2f2f82dfed24d11074c397606515d3f40d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,170,126,47,47,130,223,237,36,209,16,116,195,151,96,101,21,211,244,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
