Audio tracks can be imported into the list by using only the file browser, since the 'drag and drop' method is not supported.\n\nWorking with multiple items at the same time is possible. Sound Normalizer supports several files types, namely MP3, FLAC, WAV, WAVE, MPGA and FLA.\n\nSo, you can view the file properties of a song when it comes to the bit rate, channel mode, coding method, sample rate and size. So, you can test its average level to find out the recommended maximum volume level.\n\nYou can adjust the volume normalization level for the left and right channel, and save the new track to file. Furthermore, you can preview songs in a built-in audio player, tags (ID3v1 and ID3v2), convert items to WAV, MP3 or FLAC, as well as use the undo and redo functions. But you can also clear the database and make the app beep when a task is done.\n\nSound Normalizer supports multiple themes and languages for the interface, has a good response time, quickly finishes a task and delivers good results without freezing, crashing or displaying error dialogs; we have not come across any problems in our tests. There is also a help file available. Sound Normalizer can be used by individuals of any level of experience.\n\n\n\nHere are some key features of &quot;Sound Normalizer&quot;:\n\nMp3, FLAC, Ogg, APE and Wav (PCM 8, 16, 24, 32 bits, DSP, GSM, IMA ADPCM, MS ADPCM, AC3, MP3, MP2, OGG, A-LAW, u-LAW) Normalizer;\nConverting APE to Wav (PCM 8, 16, 24, 32 bits, DSP, GSM, IMA ADPCM, MS ADPCM, AC3, MP3, MP2, OGG, A-LAW, u-LAW);\nConverting Ogg to Wav files;\nSupport pre-listen audio file;\nSupport FLAC, Ogg, ID3 v1 and v2 tag (Artist/Title/Genre and so on).\n\nWhat's new in Sound Normalizer 5.72:\n\nMarch 19th, 2014\n\nImproved support of Mp3 files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n\nSound Card\nAdministrative permissions\nWindows All\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Installation]\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ UnRar and Install Setup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ That's it!
