Jac is in fighting mode  \n                    to secure Ric's old job. But whilst trying to  \n                    make amends for a row with Chrissie, she fails  \n                    to do pre-op checks on a high-risk patient, and  \n                    they nearly lose him on the table. With her  \n                    chance of promotion in jeopardy, she pins the  \n                    blame on Chrissie.

But can he accept the awful truth and get  \n                    her formally sectioned? Donna has to bring her  \n                    daughter Mia into work and hide her from  \n                    Hanssen while getting AAU through a ward  \n                    inspection. When Mary-Claire and Elizabeth come  \n                    to the rescue she thinks she's survived a  \n                    nightmare day, but then Mia springs one last  \n                    surprise on her.                         \n                                                         \n                                                                                                \n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n                     \n                        Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68ae22247ace7998ab78b44e21cac297d629f94d","amp;dn":"Holby.City.S13E04.720p.HDTV.x264-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68ae22247ace7998ab78b44e21cac297d629f94d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,174,34,36,122,206,121,152,171,120,180,78,33,202,194,151,214,41,249,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
