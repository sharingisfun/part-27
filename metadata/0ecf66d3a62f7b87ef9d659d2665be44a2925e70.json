When he accidentally lands at EmmaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pig farm, he realizes that true happiness waits just around the corner... Emma is a pig-breeder at a shabby and indebted farm. She slaughters the pigs in her own way: she treats them lovingly till the last day; the lethal cut shows something like tenderness and in EmmaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strong arms the dying animals cease bleeding, calmly and submittingly. But Emma is lonely. The missing man in her life is replaced by her motor-bike. But the loneliness stays. Until one night when a Jaguar crashes on her farm. Inside the wrecked car lies an unconscious man and a bag full of money. EmmaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s luck seems to be perfect: fate has thrown money Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and a man, Max Ã¢â‚¬â€œ into her lap. Suspecting that he has stolen the money, Emma hides the man in her bed and the money under her bed. But soon Hans, MaxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best friend and employer, turns up and wants his money back. In an attempt to reconciliate, Hans brings Max to a nearby hospital. Emma overcomes her shyness and finally brings him back home to the farm. Their last days together are sweetened by happiness, but MaxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s days are numbered. Finally, he takes an example from the pigs and surrenders to EmmaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tender nature.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Emmas.Glueck.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 736,227,328 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:39:07\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD 1.0.1\nFrame Size ......................................: 608x272 (AR: 2.235)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 865 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.209 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [], [N-VOP], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 112 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424992/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424992/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGerman audio; English, French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ecf66d3a62f7b87ef9d659d2665be44a2925e70","amp;dn":"Emma%27s+Bliss+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ecf66d3a62f7b87ef9d659d2665be44a2925e70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,207,102,211,166,47,123,135,239,157,101,157,38,101,190,68,162,146,94,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
