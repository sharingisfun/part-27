And as all the old legends make so very clear, humans are the natural enemies of...The Darkstalkers. Now, one man has made it his duty to seek out and destroy those who would threaten and eclipse humanity&amp;#039;s future. Bearing a sword that seems almost...alive...he stands ready to fight all those who have dedicated their lives to The Dark. Yet, what of the Darkstalkers? Surely such powerful beings have their own reasons for what they do...and their own plans and ambitions concerning both the human world and...The Demon World.\n\nThis show is based on the Capcom fighting games. \n\nFormat: AVI\nLanguage: Japanese (w/ English subtitles)\n4 Episodes (approx 40min each)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ac60de4d283e1312e97a27c5c4847d4eb270077","amp;dn":"Darkstalkers+%28Anime+OVA%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ac60de4d283e1312e97a27c5c4847d4eb270077","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,198,13,228,210,131,225,49,46,151,162,124,92,72,71,212,235,39,0,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
