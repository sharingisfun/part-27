And for a price a man may buy himself a lovely sea-wife. He may have and hold and keep her. And he will tell himself that he is her master. But from his first look into those wide, questioning, liquid eyes, he will be just as transformed as she. He will be equally ensnared. And the witch will have her true payment.\n\nMargo Lanagan weaves an extraordinary tale of desire, despair, and transformation. With devastatingly beautiful prose, she reveals characters capable of unspeakable cruelty, but also unspoken love.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f6b2626d4e2d5b7b027b1cb895f00db6dc37654","amp;dn":"Lanagan%2C+Margo+-+The+Brides+of+Rollrock+Island.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f6b2626d4e2d5b7b027b1cb895f00db6dc37654","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,107,38,38,212,226,213,183,176,39,177,203,137,95,0,219,109,195,118,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
