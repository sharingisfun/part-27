It has an outstanding gameplay, good story, and a great soundtrack, but the bad camera and the boring race missions can blow the party.\n\nBasically, you start the game with Spider-Man fighting Venom, then you are left in town and given some additional missions that are out of the storyline so they can keep you some time. Everytime you complete a mission, you are given some of these tasks. They can be different, starting from city events, to races or kicking some gangs arround the city. They are fine, but there are way too many.\n\nThe gameplay looks simple, easy to use, you can swing like three buildings with your web in less then three seconds exept for the camera, which is very bad, especially when you are fighting. You can&amp;#039;t decide who you attack, and that makes it not good.\n\nThe technical graphics are fine, I mean, when the game&amp;#039;s visual design is comic based there isn&amp;#039;t much work for the graphics and any other special effects.\n\nExept Spider-Man you can play with other characters that have their own special powers, but I wouldn&amp;#039;t tell with who exactly right now, to prevent from any possible spoilers.\n\nUltimate Spider-Man has a great music, fast and dynamic. You can just make some moves with your hero arround time and listen to the rhytm of the music without getting bored.\n\nSo, as an overview, I would say that Ultimate Spider-Man is a fine game that can offer you like 20 hours of fun gameplay, but after that it will become pretty boring, especially because of those thousands races.\n\n\nWindows XP\n256MB\nCD/DVD-ROM\n32MB\nDirectX 9.0c","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e0eaf7ea94061614155a886474dcc94299deb9d","amp;dn":"Ultimate+Spider-man+DEViANCE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e0eaf7ea94061614155a886474dcc94299deb9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,14,175,126,169,64,97,97,65,85,168,134,71,77,204,148,41,157,235,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
