Actually, the Scottish singer -- born Marie McDonald McLaughlin Lawrie -- had been a star in Britain since 1964, when she hit the Top Ten with a raucous version of &quot;Shout.&quot; Lulu's mid-'60s recordings (which included a version of &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot; that preceded Them's hit rendition) were often surprisingly rowdy and R&amp;B-influenced. Although she didn't match Dusty Springfield, her Brenda Lee-like rasp could be quite gutsy and soulful. Her career was headed in a determinedly middle-of-the-road direction by the late '60s, which saw her hosting a British variety show and marrying Bee Gee Maurice Gibb (they later divorced). Lulu raised a few eyebrows by traveling to Muscle Shoals studios to record her 1970 album New Routes and releasing a double-sided single of David Bowie tunes (which Bowie also played on and co-produced) in 1973. Lulu has recorded intermittently ever since -- her well-received 2004 album Back on Track coincided with a U.K. tour marking 40 years since her first appearance on the charts -- and she also continues to make TV and radio appearances in the U.K. \n\n\nThis issue contains all of her albums New Routes (1970) and Melody Fair (1970) along with bonus tracks.\nTracklist:\nCD1\n01 - Marley Purt Drive\n02 - In The Morning\n03 - People In Love\n04 - After All (I Live My Life)\n05 - Feelin' Alight\n06 - Dirty Old Man\n07 - Oh Me Oh My (I'm A Fool For You Baby)\n08 - Is That You Love\n09 - Mr. Bojangles\n10 - Where's Eddie\n11 - Sweep Around Your Own Back Door\n12 - Good Day Sunshine\n13 - After The Feeling Is Gone\n14 - I Don't Care Anymore\n15 - (Don't Go) Please Stay\n16 - Melody Fair\n17 - Take Good Care Of Yourself\n18 - Vine Street\n19 - Move To My Rhythm\n20 - To The Other Woman (I'm The Other Woman)\n21 - Hum A Song (From Your Heart)\n22 - Sweet Memories\n23 - Saved\n\nCD2\n01 - Bury Me Down By The River\n02 - Got To Believe In Love\n03 - Jokers Wild\n04 - Come Down In Time\n05 - Everybody'd Got To Clap\n06 - Back Home\n07 - Things Are Getting Better\n08 - Love Song\n09 - Goodbye My Love, Goodbye\n10 - It Takes A Real Man (To Bring Out The Woman In Me)\n11 - You Ain't Wrong You Just Ain't Right\n12 - Even If I Could Change\n13 - Hum A Song (From Your Heart) SESSION VERSION\n14 - I Don't Care Anymore EARLY MIX\n15 - Got To Believe In Love EARLY VERSION\n16 - Povera Me (Oh Me Oh My)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2f0506154f474b26254dacab3cc7d76947c0fb4","amp;dn":"Lulu+-+The+Atco+Sessions+%281969-1972%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2f0506154f474b26254dacab3cc7d76947c0fb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,240,80,97,84,244,116,178,98,84,218,202,179,204,125,118,148,124,15,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
