Including a ruthless yet unsuspecting TV executive, a conniving rock star wannabe, a desperate abused teenager, a pair of star-crossed Mafioso lovers, and even the world's last ultra-hero who must choose - staying with the love of his life while the world goes to Hell (literally), or go fight the Great Cthulhu in a desperate (and most likely futile) attempt to save the remnants of humanity from being destroyed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8de7693d6fa2a3fa7d27064a74792f7d37e56c5a","amp;dn":"Nightmare+World+Vol.+2-Leave+the+Light+On+%5BGraphic+Novel%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8de7693d6fa2a3fa7d27064a74792f7d37e56c5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,231,105,61,111,162,163,250,125,39,6,74,116,121,47,125,55,229,108,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
