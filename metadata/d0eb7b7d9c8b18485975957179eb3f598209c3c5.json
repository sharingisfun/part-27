The length to which he commented himself to this character was Oscar worthy, to say the least. I was so taken, I immediately preordered it to own and add to my collection. As I have watched it repeatedly over the years, my original assessment remains the same...a 10 plus! I am in shock that neither Leonardo nor the film industry has not made mention of this film when listing or crediting his fabulous and diverse character choices during his career. In my opinion, his work in this film is far and away better than even the Titanic. He really seemed to grasp every aspect of this tormented genius character which had far more depth than the Titanic character. I highly recommend you see and buy this movie.\n\n\nInfo o pliku CD1\n========================================\n\nRozmiar pliku.....: 701 MB (or 718,152 KB or 735,387,648 bytes)\nCzas trwania......: 01:00:57 (87,692 fr)\n\nKodek Video..: DivX 3 Low-Motion\nVideo Bitrate: 1154 kb/s\nFPS: 23.976 fps\nRozdzielczo[\u0007...: 640x336 (1.90:1) [=40:21]\n\nKodek Audio..: ac3 (0x2000) Dolby Laboratories, Inc\nAudio Bitrate: 448 kb/s (5 ch) CBR \nCzestotliwosc probkowania: 48000 Hz\n\nInfo o pliku CD2\n========================================\n\nRozmiar pliku.....: 698 MB (or 715,274 KB or 732,440,576 bytes)\nCzas trwania......: 00:50:33 (72,717 fr)\n\nKodek Video..: DivX 3 Low-Motion\nVideo Bitrate: 1478 kb/s\nFPS: 23.976 fps\nRozdzielczo[\u0007...: 640x336 (1.90:1) [=40:21]\n\nKodek Audio..: ac3 (0x2000) Dolby Laboratories, Inc\nAudio Bitrate: 448 kb/s (5 ch) CBR \nCzestotliwosc probkowania: 48000 Hz\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0eb7b7d9c8b18485975957179eb3f598209c3c5","amp;dn":"Total+Eclipse+-+CD2+DVDRip+DivX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0eb7b7d9c8b18485975957179eb3f598209c3c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,235,123,125,156,139,24,72,89,117,149,113,121,235,63,89,130,9,195,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
