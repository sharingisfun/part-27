Hopefully, they will have a Christian attitude about it all - it is Holy Week, after all.\n\nA disclaimer on the site reads: &quot;This is a parody created for entertainment purposes only. I do not own the rights to the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber or the likenesses of Jim Henson's Muppets, unfortunately. I'd be a whole lot cooler if I did.&quot;\n\n\nFEATURING\n\nKermit ...
