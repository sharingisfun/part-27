The aim is to cover all aspects of this interdisciplinary technology where knowledge, methods and expertise are required from chemistry, biochemistry, microbiology, genetics, chemical engineering and computer science. Volumes are organized topically and provide a comprehensive discussion of developments in the respective field over the past 3-5 years. The series also discusses new discoveries and applications. Special volumes are dedicated to selected topics which focus on new biotechnological products and new processes for their synthesis and purification. In general, special volumes are edited by well-known guest editors. The series editor and publisher will however always be pleased to receive suggestions and supplementary information. Manuscripts are accepted in English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3253247a2c4e4ac624a080ea4c8dd8057dfe9dfe","amp;dn":"Bioluminescence+-+Fundamentals+and+Applications+in+Biotechnology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3253247a2c4e4ac624a080ea4c8dd8057dfe9dfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,83,36,122,44,78,74,198,36,160,128,234,76,141,216,5,125,254,157,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
