He has a dog named Dude. And more importantly, he and his lover SFPD Inspector Kane Morgan now share Miki's converted warehouse.\n\nFor the first time ever, Miki's living a happy and normal-ish life, but when Valentine's Day rolls around, Miki realizes he knows next to nothing about being domestic or domesticated. Nothing about the traditional lover's holiday makes sense to him, but Miki wants to give Kane a Valentine's Day the man will never forget.\n\nCan he pull off a day of wine and roses? Or will his screwed-up childhood come back and bite Miki in the ass?\n\nAgain","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58f5773e5644a9902e3ef2c6bd78728bfcf28e24","amp;dn":"Rhys+Ford+-+Sinners+Book+2.5+The+Devil%27s+Brew","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58f5773e5644a9902e3ef2c6bd78728bfcf28e24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,245,119,62,86,68,169,144,46,62,242,198,189,120,114,139,252,242,142,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
