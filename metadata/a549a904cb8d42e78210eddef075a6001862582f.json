Louiss and Petrucciani (who brought in &quot;I Wrote You a Song&quot; and &quot;Simply Bop&quot;) contributed two songs apiece and co-wrote &quot;Jean-Philippe Herbien.&quot; In addition, they perform &quot;All the Things You Are,&quot; &quot;So What,&quot; and &quot;These Foolish Things.&quot; The blend between Louiss' organ and Petrucciani's piano is quite attractive, and they work together quite well, leaving enough space for their individual personalities to emerge yet forming a highly appealing ensemble sound.
