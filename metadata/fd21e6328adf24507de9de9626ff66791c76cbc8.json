It is a soap opera drama of movies connecting into a bigger storyline or self contained watchable fan edit films. The concept surrounds the Silence Aliens from Doctor Who who try to invade our history through any means possible be it Alien abductions, Alien take overs, spiritual possession, or Alien zombie parasites. As the series continues each episode brings us closer to the silence, but every episode always remains as a self contained fan film.\n\nSynopsis OUTLINE:\nHUMANITIES FINAL BATTLE AGAINST THE SILENCE.\n\nThis series in a sense is a sequel to the hit 1996 series called &quot;Dark Skies&quot; on NBC which inspired this project to begin with.\nDark Skies TV show was a weekly TV show based around historical events that had a Alien Twist intertwined into history.\nMy series is kinda similar to this concept: Example: Apollo 11 they find Aliens on the moon&quot;\n\nEventually the story in later episodes stray away from Dark skies, but I tried to keep this crossover to historical events and time periods. Series starts in the ancient past and works it way up to our current future and beyond.\n----------------------------------------------------------\nThe full length feature will be released soon as a 5 hour movie but for now enjoy how this plays out","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd21e6328adf24507de9de9626ff66791c76cbc8","amp;dn":"Dark+Skies+Invasion+%282015%29+S05E03+Special+Edition+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd21e6328adf24507de9de9626ff66791c76cbc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,33,230,50,138,223,36,80,125,233,222,150,38,255,102,121,28,118,203,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
