Because of Debra's unrelenting pursuit, Miami Metro is just one step away from discovering the identity of the Trinity Killer. And Dexter can't let that happen. Arthur's arrest would not only deprive Dexter of a satisfying kill, it would also expose the secret life Dexter's been leading in his pursuit of this monster. Dexter must take drastic action to buy himself time to deal with Trinity in his own fashion. Meanwhile, Rita decides to confide in Dexter, which doesn't go as well as she'd hoped. LaGuerta and Batista's breach of ethics paints them into a very tight corner. And Arthur, who still can't understand why Dexter didn't simply turn him in, begins his own bloody investigation into Kyle Butler.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93c33f117da17dc57d8002317b2be444bd6b08d9","amp;dn":"Dexter+S04E11+HDTV+XviD+SoftSub+Eng+Pol","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93c33f117da17dc57d8002317b2be444bd6b08d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,195,63,17,125,161,125,197,125,128,2,49,123,43,228,68,189,107,8,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
