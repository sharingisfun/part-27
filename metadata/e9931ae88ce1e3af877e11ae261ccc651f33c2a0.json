It is not a sequel to Terminal Velocity, but the two games share basic game mechanics and use the same engine, although it was redesigned to run natively under Windows 95.\n\nLater, an expansion pack called F-Zone was created, and eventually a sequel titled Hellbender, was made.\n\nPlayers assume the role of a pilot named Councilor flying a fighter craft to eight worlds (many based on real places, like Mars and New York) controlled by a militant robotic force called the Bions. Players fight three missions on each planet. Each of the missions involves destroying vital military targets in order to halt the Bions' progress on the planet. Players must then destroy either one or two Guardians who are the commanders of the particular Bion invasion force. Once players are done with one planet, they then move on to the next one.\n\nThe Bions are not independent thinking machines; they are controlled by the Guardian(s) of the respective planets. The Guardians are far more intelligent than the lesser BionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½their IQ equals that of a super-computerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and destroying them will halt the Bions on the planet.\n\nThere are seven weapons in all, the main being the Servo-Kinetic Laser (SKL), the player's only weapon at the start of the game. Other weapons such as Vipers (VIP) and Rapid-Fire Lasers (RFL20) are available to collect throughout the game.\n\n\n\n*** PLEASE READ THESE COMPATIBILITY NOTES BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO PLAY ***\n\n\n* The installer is 16-bit, so it won't work on x64 versions of Windows.\n  Instead, copy the FURY3 folder from the CD to your hard drive. I put mine in:\n  &quot;%userprofile%My DocumentsMy GamesFury 3&quot;\n  You can also run it from the CD, but settings/scores won't be saved obviously.\n\n* This game was intended for Windows 3.1 and Windows 95. USB wasn't around then\n  so don't expect your USB joystick/gamepad/whatever to work. Trust me, I've\n  tried. You will get it working if you can map the buttons to keyboard inputs,\n  then tell Fury 3 to only use the keyboard. This won't give you analog input\n  on the turning/throttle though.\n\n* Not sure about x86 versions of Windows, but full-screen doesn't work on x64.\n  If you try it, you just get a small window. The next best thing is just\n  maximize the window instead. The performance is still fab on CPU's today.\n\n* If you find the sound delays by a second or two, go in the sound options, then\n  advanced, and lower the buffer count to 3 with size 2048. You didn't need to\n  modify this setting in the first place!\n\n* I've got 5.1 surround and I've not noticed any surround sound happening when\n  using the surround sound mode. You get much better sound quality using mono.\n\n* I've not tried F! Zone yet, so don't bitch at me if it doesn't work.\n\n\nGood luck, CG1 :3\n\nIf you like this try Terminal Velocity (it's made by the same people). I found\nit more fun, with better sound/graphics, AND THE GAMEPADS WORK IN DOSBOX!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9931ae88ce1e3af877e11ae261ccc651f33c2a0","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Fury+3+with+F%21+Zone","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9931ae88ce1e3af877e11ae261ccc651f33c2a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,147,26,232,140,225,227,175,135,126,17,174,38,28,204,101,31,51,194,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
