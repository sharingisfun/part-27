It is often considered, along with The Three Musketeers, as Dumas's most popular work. The writing of the work was completed in 1844. Like many of his novels, it is expanded from the plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet.\n\nThe story takes place in France, Italy, islands in the Mediterranean and the Levant during the historical events of 1815ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1838 (from just before the Hundred Days through the reign of Louis-Philippe of France). The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book. It is primarily concerned with themes of justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness, and is told in the style of an adventure story. (Summary from Wikipedia)\n\n\n\n\nAn M4B file is an audio file which can be bookmarked. This is the audio-book file type. These files can have chapter markers which can be skipped through as you would skip through files on a play list. They can have built in cover art and chapter images. They will remember where you left off each time you stop the file and come back to it . And variable speed settings on Ipods and a growing number of other mp3 players can be utilized by this file type. The ability to bookmark allows for as little as one large file instead of many small ones without the burden of fast forwarding to find your spot every time you resume listening or the fear of otherwise losing your place. The reduced number of files also makes browsing through your files to find your book and your place in it much less effort.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4e189e3e1098ffd75ee6043f26be9f194ac79f7","amp;dn":"Librivox+M4B+-+Count+of+Monte+Cristo+by+Alexandre+Dumas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4e189e3e1098ffd75ee6043f26be9f194ac79f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,225,137,227,225,9,143,253,117,238,96,67,242,107,233,241,148,172,121,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
