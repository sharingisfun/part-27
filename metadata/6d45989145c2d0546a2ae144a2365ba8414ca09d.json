The Dark Horse name for this series is a little confusing, however, as these aren't particularly the &quot;early adventures&quot;. Williamson's newspaper series, as well as some issues of the initial Marvel comic book run, easily pre-date not only the creation date of these strips, but also their place in the Star Wars time line.\nThese adventures are best placed about a year prior to the opening of Episode V. They are clearly distanced from Williamson's newspaper work, which is best seen as occurring closer to the end of Episode IV.\n\nSince this work was completed at such an early stage in the development of the Star Wars universe as a whole, some parts are dubiously canonical in the light of, say, Episode III.\n\nNumber of issues: 9\nFiles format: CBR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d45989145c2d0546a2ae144a2365ba8414ca09d","amp;dn":"Classic+Star+Wars%3A+The+Early+Adventures+%281994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d45989145c2d0546a2ae144a2365ba8414ca09d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,69,152,145,69,194,208,84,106,42,225,68,162,54,91,168,65,76,160,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
