After 45 dates, German thrash titans KREATOR conclude their extensive European tour in support of their highly successful latest album, Ã‚Â»Phantom AntichristÃ‚Â« in their home area. The sold-out show was filmed by 24 cameras, guitar-cams and even moshpit-cams were used to record this masterpiece of a live document. 90 minutes of pure on stage thrash mayhem, 3 video clips and an in-depth backstage documentary make Ã‚Â»Dying AliveÃ‚Â« the live DVD/Blu Ray you ever wanted! Being released in different formats containing high quality bonus materials, this is nothing but suitable for the kings of teutonic thrash!\nÃ¢â‚¬Å¾This show on December 22, 2012 was something special for us. One day after the officially announced apocalypse the homecoming show at Turbinenhalle was really intense. Before that we were touring on various continents and played some really special gigs. But none of them was as energized. Fans from all over Germany, Belgium and Holland came to make this DVD something magical. We can rely on our fans and on concerts in the ruhr area anyway. While editing the footage i realized how great all came into place that December night. Thanks to all the fans! This DVD is for you!Ã¢â‚¬Å“ - Mille Petrozza\nTracklist:\nLive in Oberhausen, Germany, 2012\n01. Intro: Mars Mantra\n02. Phantom Antichrist\n03. From Flood Into Fire\n04. Enemy Of God\n05.
