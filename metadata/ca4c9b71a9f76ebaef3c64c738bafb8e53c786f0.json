Indie, Simulation\r\n\r\nInfo:\r\n\r\nSpace Station Landmark has gone offline. All attempted contact with Landmark has been futile. Its nearby satellites are mysteriously experiencing a blackout. Decades worth of data are still uncollected. Thatâ€™s where you come in, Candidate Alpha. We need you to collect the Data Caches of information adrift in space. A number of collection sites have been located, but there are too many unknown astrophysical factors. We cannot guarantee your safety.\r\n\r\nViolet: Space Mission is a 2D precision action game in space, where you take the role of Candidate Alpha sent on the top-secret Violet Programme. Play through uniquely designed missions to retrieve the Data Caches and uncover the secrets hiding in them. Experience a beautifully crafted 2D space and be very aware of the dangers that lurk in it. Get accustomed to Zero Gravity gameplay, where every tiny move you make matters. Good luck and Godspeed.\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements:\r\n\r\nNOTE: Tested and works on Windows 7 (x86/x64) - Don't know If It works on Windows 10\r\n\r\nMINIMUM\r\n\r\nOS: Win XP, 7\r\nProcessor: 1.2 Ghz+\r\nMemory: 1024 MB RAM\r\nGraphics: 256 MB\r\nDirectX: Version 9.0\r\nStorage: 384 MB available space\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDED\r\n\r\nOS: Win XP, 7\r\nProcessor: 2 Ghz\r\nMemory: 2048 MB RAM\r\nGraphics: 1 GB\r\nDirectX: Version 9.0\r\nStorage: 384 MB available space\r\n\r\n\r\nEnJoY iT! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca4c9b71a9f76ebaef3c64c738bafb8e53c786f0","amp;dn":"VIOLET.Space.Mission-ALiAS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca4c9b71a9f76ebaef3c64c738bafb8e53c786f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,76,155,113,169,247,110,186,239,60,100,199,56,186,251,142,83,199,134,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
