It was not human, and it certainly was not animal, for it did not belong to this earth as known to man' \r\nRudyard Kipling, celebrated author of The Jungle Book, the Just So Stories and other entertaining fictions, was also a master of the short story in which he was able to combine the strange and unnerving in order to draw the reader into the world of his own dark imaginings. \r\nThis collection presents the best of these strange tales in which ghosts, monsters and inexplicable happenings abound. From the exotic and magical locale of India, to the leafy suburbs of England and then to the blood-soaked trenches of the First World War, Kipling provides us with a chilling array of experiences and images which will linger long in the memory","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e3b40568f701d894f8c04463dc3568b017fe11c","amp;dn":"Strange+Tales+-+Rudyard+Kipling","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e3b40568f701d894f8c04463dc3568b017fe11c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,59,64,86,143,112,29,137,79,140,4,70,61,195,86,139,1,127,225,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
