You can read the write up at IMDb and so forth but it's better to let the plot unfold.  \n\nAnd the look of the film is first rate right down to the tackiness of an apartment where the drapes, both chairs and sofa are all of the same fabric.\n\nOk you get past that and into the film and Cyd Charisse appears.  I suppose I saw the name in the credits.  But that &quot;who that?&quot; stuck with me until I finished the film.  Charisse is usually partnered with a dancer.  But here her beauty steals the show just being in it.  Add to that the perfect 50's wardrobe and hair.  It's noticeable that the costumer was a first class designer in this small film.\n\nThe print of this is nice and clear: something I'm appreciating all over after having been ruined by years of watching old films on tv interrupted by commercials.\n\nnotes written May 7th, 2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e67a92aee6839fc97600c26a59f00aa6d2665709","amp;dn":"Tension+%281950%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e67a92aee6839fc97600c26a59f00aa6d2665709","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,122,146,174,230,131,159,201,118,0,194,106,89,240,10,166,210,102,87,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
