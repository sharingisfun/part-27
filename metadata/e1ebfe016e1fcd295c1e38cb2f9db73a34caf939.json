There are two versions of that song, one with Cathy Cavadini performing Tanya's version and the other being Linda Ronstadt performing the finale version, both for that film.\n\nLinda Ronstadt (born July 15, 1946) is an American popular music vocalist and entertainer. Her many vocal styles in a variety of genres have resonated with the general public over the course of her four-decade career. As a result, she has earned multiple Grammy Awards, two Academy of Country Music awards, an Emmy Award, an ALMA Award, numerous United States and internationally certified gold, platinum and multiplatinum albums, in addition to Tony Award and Golden Globe nominations.\n\nA singer-songwriter and record producer, she is recognized as a definitive interpreter of songs. Being one of music's most versatile, and commercially successful female singers in U.S. history, she is recognized for her many public stages of self-reinvention and public incarnations.\n\nWith a one time standing as the Queen of Rock where she was bestowed the title of &quot;highest paid woman in rock&quot;, and known as the First Lady of Rock, she has more recently emerged as music matriarch and international arts advocate. Ronstadt has collaborated with more artists from a diverse spectrum of genres ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ including Billy Eckstine, Frank Zappa, Rosemary Clooney, Flaco JimÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nez, Philip Glass, The Chieftains, Gram Parsons - than perhaps any popular music vocalist in modern U.S. history, lending her voice to over 120 albums around the world.\n\nIn total, she has released over 30 solo albums, more than 15 compilations or greatest hits albums. Ronstadt has charted thirty-eight Billboard Hot 100 singles, twenty-one of which have reached the top 40, ten of which have reached the top 10, three peaking at No. 2, the No. 1 hit, &quot;You're No Good.&quot; In the UK, her single &quot;Blue Bayou&quot; reached the UK Top 40 and the duet with Aaron Neville, &quot;Don't Know Much&quot;, peaked at #2 in November 1989. In addition, she has charted thirty-six albums, ten Top 10 albums, and three No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200 Pop Album Charts.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1ebfe016e1fcd295c1e38cb2f9db73a34caf939","amp;dn":"Linda+Ronstadt+-+Dreams+to+Dream+%28An+American+Tail%29++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1ebfe016e1fcd295c1e38cb2f9db73a34caf939","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,235,254,1,110,31,205,41,92,30,56,203,47,157,183,58,52,202,249,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
