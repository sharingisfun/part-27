When Adobe released Flex 1.0 in March 2004, a lot of designers and developers who were used to working in Flash viewed it with suspicion. Where was the timeline, what was MXML, and how was it useful for designers? With Flex 2, the answers to those questions became a little clearer, and more and more web developers started to pick up Flex. With the release of Flex 3, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s clear that Flex is now the tool for rich Internet application (RIA) development. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s easy for developers to pick up and rapidly create RIAs, and thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s now more customizability available for designers to sink their teeth into.\n\nThis book deals with the designer issues of creating RIAs in Flex Builder 3. It covers such important issues as how to control the look and feel of an application through CSS and custom skins. It also shows how you can create these skins using the familiar tools of Photoshop, Illustrator, and Flash, rather than having to struggle to learn a new interface. The book also explores using transitions and other effects to make applications more dynamic, visually interesting, and easier\nto navigate.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18c4ebc9de81fab4b8f6cea2c9b66fe80a4ff10f","amp;dn":"Foundation+Flex+for+Designers+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18c4ebc9de81fab4b8f6cea2c9b66fe80a4ff10f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,196,235,201,222,129,250,180,184,246,206,162,201,182,111,232,10,79,241,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
