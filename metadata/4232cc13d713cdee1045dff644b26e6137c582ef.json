We watch part of Obama's speech regarding this resignation, are treated to a video of a whale of a woman, and hear about a kid named Tyler who started a petition after being called a &quot;Gaytard.&quot; We see a video that Ant stumbled upon when looking up religion, talk about the types of religions he's fucked, and god dammit, the callers get their say again. We see a promotional photo from VietJet Air, reminisce about how stewardesses used to look, Ticket University helps @KyleTims get unblocked, Ant reads a few more sticker requests, and he ends the show by going through a few old-timey &quot;PathÃƒÂ©&quot; videos.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4232cc13d713cdee1045dff644b26e6137c582ef","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-09-25+%28MP4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4232cc13d713cdee1045dff644b26e6137c582ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,50,204,19,215,19,205,238,16,69,223,246,68,178,110,97,55,197,130,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
