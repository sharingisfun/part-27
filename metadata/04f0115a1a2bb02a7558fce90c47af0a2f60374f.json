The band was officially formed on June 17, 1991 in Delhi. \nThe word 'Parikrama' means 'orbital revolutions' in Sanskrit.                                                 \nThey are yet to release a full-length album, though they did release a free multimedia CD of their singles \nand videos in 2001. The band does not have any policies against their music being copied and distributed .\nThey have made their music available for download on their official website.\nThe band often fuses Indian classical music instruments like mridangam, tabla and flute \nwith conventional instruments like guitar, drums and keyboards. \nThey have been inspired and influenced by the likes of Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix and The Doors.\n\nThe first song &quot;Xerox&quot; was named 'the face of Indian rock'.\nTheir first hit single &quot;Till IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m No One Again&quot; was released in 1995 along with &quot;Open Skies&quot;. \n&quot;But it rained&quot;, was released next year 1996. This song was dedicated to the kidnappings \nthat had occurred in the Kashmir Valley, during that period.This song is probably their biggest hit. \nThey were surprised when a crowd of 40000 sang along with them in their performance for the \n&quot;Iron Maiden&quot; concert in Bangalore. Another song - &quot;Gonna Get It&quot; was released in the same year.\nTheir sixth number in succession was released in 1997 by the name of &quot;Load Up&quot;.\nThis band composed the song &quot;The Superhero&quot; for Bangalore only recently. \nThis was in due course of the visit of MicrosoftÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s chairman Bill Gates to the IT capital of India, Bangalore.\nA Parikrama original &quot;Rhythm and Blues&quot; was created in course of their jam session with Usha Uthup.\nParikrama has recently released a few more originals like the \nLord of the Rings-inspired &quot;Am I Dreaming&quot;, &quot;Tears of the Wizard&quot; and &quot;In the Middle&quot;.\nApart from &quot;But it rained&quot; another Parikrama original called &quot;Vapourize&quot; is a crowd favorite. \n&quot;Vapourize&quot; is a 7:30 minutes long song and features harmonized Guitar Solos with a Violin Solo. \n\nFor More Info, Visit Links Below : &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.parikrama.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.parikrama.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n                                                                        \n                                                                                                              [Source:Wikipedia]\n==================================================================================\n\nSeeding Will Be Slow,Be Patient. \nComment About Quality And Compatibility. \n\nSUPPORT THE ARTIST, DISTRIBUTE ALL FREE CONTENTS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. \n\nSupport Me.
