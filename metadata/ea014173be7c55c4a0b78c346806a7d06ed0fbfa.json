Founded in 1994, .net magazine is published every four weeks (13 issues per year). The magazine was initially aimed at the general Internet user, but has adapted into a title aimed at professional and amateur web designers; a significant proportion of its readers are full-time web developers. In 2011 it also launched as a digital edition for tablet computers.\n\nThe front cover features artwork from different graphic designers. Digital art and designers are also catered for in the magazine, with a dedicated section called /showcase.\n\n.net was previously sold under the name Web Builder in the USA. In December 2006, it took on the name of Practical Web Design in the wake of that particular publication's closure in the UK.\n\nArtwork is still a key part of the magazine, and it features various web designers' work in a dedicated section each issue.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea014173be7c55c4a0b78c346806a7d06ed0fbfa","amp;dn":"net+Magazine+UK+-+Summer+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea014173be7c55c4a0b78c346806a7d06ed0fbfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,1,65,115,190,124,85,196,160,183,140,52,104,6,167,208,110,208,251,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
