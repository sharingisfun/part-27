On the last day of filming Flower of the Arabian Nights in the desert city, the director took some leftover film and documented the medieval Islamic architecture that so impressed him. He used these images to persuade UNESCO to make it a world heritage site.\n\n\nFile Name .........................................: Pasolini.-.Le.mura.di.Sana'a.1971 Corto 12 min.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 89,227,264 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 12:48.880\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: DivX 5.0.2\nFrame Size ......................................: 720x576 (AR: 1.250)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 790 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.076 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], [GMC]\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 128 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\n\nThanks waskee for the rip.\n\nSpanish, english and portuguese subtitles\n\n************************* FREAKYFLICKS **************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
