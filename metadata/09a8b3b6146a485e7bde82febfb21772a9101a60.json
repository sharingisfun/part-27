The film depicts SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ss as a figure of cynical cunning and malign will, a sexual predator sowing corruption everywhere; his promotion of Jewish emancipation brings Christian WÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼rttemberg to the brink of moral and social ruination. That these qualities are conveyed through Ferdinand Marian's stunningly charismatic performance as SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ss suggests something of the film's disturbing power even as it acknowledges Jewish misery, Jud SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ss argues for still more lethal, pitiless solutions to the Jewish question. A key historical document of the twentieth century, Jud SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ss remains a deeply unsettling cinematic experience. Directed by Veit Harlan; music by Wolfgang Zeller; featuring Ferdinand Marian, Werner Krauss, Heinrich George, and Kristina SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶derbaum.
