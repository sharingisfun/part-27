It even produces its own unique white wine produced in vineyards overlooking the city's imperial architecture. Rick also learns the essential etiquette to its coffee house culture and indulges in the city's sweet tooth by enjoying a plate or two of apple strudel and sacher torte. And no visit to Vienna would be complete without a concert of Mozart or Strauss, whose music was undeniably inspired by this unforgettable city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 13-May-2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b913f2bd8d3b5e2038bcdefaa5303186e895815","amp;dn":"Rick+Steins+Long+Weekends+S01E04+Vienna+480p.HDTV.x264-RMTeam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b913f2bd8d3b5e2038bcdefaa5303186e895815","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,145,63,43,216,211,181,226,3,139,205,239,170,83,3,24,110,137,88,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
