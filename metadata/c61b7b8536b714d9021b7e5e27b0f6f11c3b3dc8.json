Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\n\ndescription:\n\nThe Abingdon Old Testament Commentaries series offers compact, critical commentaries on all the books of the Old Testament. In addition to providing fundamental information on and insights into Old Testament writings, these commentaries exemplify the tasks and procedures of careful, critical exegesis so as to assist students of the Old Testament in coming to an informed engagement of the biblical texts themselves. These commentaries are written with special attention to the needs and interests of theology students, but they will also be useful for students in upper-level college or university settings, as well as for pastors and other church leaders.\n\nEach volume consists of four parts: \n-- an introduction that addresses the key issues raised by the writing; the literary genre, structure, and character of the writing; the occasional and situational context of the writing, including its wider social and historical context; and the theological and ethical significance of the writing within these several contexts\n-- a commentary on the text, organized by literary units, covering literary analysis, exegetical analysis, and theological and ethical analysis\n-- an annotated bibliography\n-- a brief subject index\n\nIn this volume on Deuteronomy, Brueggemann shows the significance of the Book of Deuteronomy to the shape and substance of Israel's faith in the Old Testament.  Deuteronomy gave classic articulation to the main themes characteristic of Judaism, and, derivatively, of Christianity.  Brueggemann emphasizes that Deuteronomy is an expression of covenant theology, whereby YHWH and Israel are pledged to exclusive loyalty and fidelity to each other; YHWH is to assure the well-being of Israel, and Israel is to live in trust and obedience to YHWH.  In examining the relationship of Israel to God, Brueggemann makes suggestions on how such covenant fidelity might be lived out by believers today.\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nWalter Brueggemann is William Marcellus McPheeters Professor Emeritus of Old Testament at Columbia Theological Seminary. A past president of the Society of Biblical Literature, he is one of today's preeminent interpreters of Scripture.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c61b7b8536b714d9021b7e5e27b0f6f11c3b3dc8","amp;dn":"Walter+Brueggemann+-+Deuteronomy+%28Commentary%29+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c61b7b8536b714d9021b7e5e27b0f6f11c3b3dc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,27,123,133,54,183,20,217,2,27,126,94,39,176,246,241,28,59,61,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
