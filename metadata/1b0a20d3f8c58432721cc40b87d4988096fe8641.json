Sanders (Butterworth-Heinemann, 1999).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 0750670223\r\n\r\nIn this easy-to-understand book, the author, drawing on his many years of practical experience, addresses the problems experienced with management of change in chemical plants. He cites examples of the consequences of the insufficient review of changes implemented to solve one problem, which then create another.\r\nUnwise chemical plant modifications are one of the major causes of chemical plant accidents and all proposed good ideas involving change require careful review and analysis before implementation. Illustrated with many case histories this book highlights the incidents of unforseen, undesirable consequences of unwise change within chemical and petrochemical plants and petroleum refineries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustrated with many case histories, this book highlights the incidents of unforeseen, undesirable consequences of unwise change within chemical and petrochemical and petroleum refineries. \r\n\r\nProvides a series of short, descriptive accidents\r\n\r\nSupplemented with sketches and vivid photos\r\n\r\nOffers practical sections on mechanical integrity, management of change, and incident investigation programs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b0a20d3f8c58432721cc40b87d4988096fe8641","amp;dn":"Chemical+Process+Safety+-+Learning+from+Case+Histories","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b0a20d3f8c58432721cc40b87d4988096fe8641","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,10,32,211,248,197,132,50,114,28,196,11,135,212,152,128,150,254,134,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
