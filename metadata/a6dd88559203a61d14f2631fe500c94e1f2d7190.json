This terrific and comprehensive cookbook offers authentic, eclectic, homespun recipes that showcase a variety of different grains at their best, whether on their own or cooked with vegetables or meat. From the familiar oat to exotic ancient crops, The Whole Grain Cookbook celebrates the good eating offered by 20 different whole grains: amaranth, quinoa, corn (maize), wheat, spelt, QK-77, triticale, rye, oats, rice, barley, millet, teff, sorghum, fonio, buckwheat, chickpeas, beans and peas, seeds, and nuts.  \nAlso included is information on how to store whole grain and how to grind your own meal and flour with a home milling machine (as with coffee and pepper, freshly ground grains are more flavorful, and less expensive, than store-bought). Appetizing, informative, and uncomplicated, this is a resource youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll return to again and again. \n\nAbout the Author\nA. D.
