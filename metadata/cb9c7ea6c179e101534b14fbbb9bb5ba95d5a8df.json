Update XQuartz after installation to latest version,XQuartz is\ninstalled in your Utilities folder.\n\n(This will update and replace X11 system of OS X)\n\n3. Reboot..Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ !\n\n4. Drag FL X Studio to Applications folder or any other location... You're done!!\n\nNote:\n\nThis version of FruityLoops is ported from Wineskin, so... IT WILL NOT WORK with your native Mac VST or AU Instruments..\n\nThis port is more or less for playing around with Fruityloops, without having to install a full Windows operating system on your computer. It's just for fun..\n\nImage Line haven't made a native Mac app yet, although I heard rumors of iPad and iPhone versions of FL Studio. I still haven't seen any beta version for OSX!\n\nHowever, if you want to use certain VST instruments, you can install them into the Wineskin Application. Right click on the app, and choose: 'Show Package Contents'. There is a Wineskin app. Choose option: 'Install Software' and select your installation file.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨\n\n(This must to be a Windows binary .exe file!) HAVE FUN!!
