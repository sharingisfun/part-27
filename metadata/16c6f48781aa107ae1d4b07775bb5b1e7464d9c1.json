Another gem packed collection of net audio culled from all over the world. One from ccMixter, a couple from Jamendo, others from various netlabels... all equally terrific.\n\nAbout the blocSonic.com netBloc series:\n\nMany things are currently happening which are allowing for netlabels increased importance in the world of recorded music. The mainstream music industry's reluctance to trust music fans to the music they purchase. Their belief that music should be licensed for each use. Their dependence on Digital Rights Management scams to police their music. The explosion of the number of netlabels. The increase in variety and quality of the music offered by netlabels.\n\nWith this mountain of netlabel music available, the problem arises that one doesn't have the time to filter through it all and find the gems. blocSonic exists for this purpose. blocSonic is beginning it's existence as a simple blog at which I will post monthly compilations called netBlocs. Each of these compilations feature:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\t10 of the best netlabel tracks available in three formats Ã¢â‚¬â€œ FLAC, 320kbs MP3 and 192kbs MP3\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\t30+ page PDF booklet with full track information, bios and more.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tComplete package art in three formats Ã¢â‚¬â€œ tif, eps and pdf\n\n\nPlease check out our previous releases here\n\n\nThis audio is part of the collection: blocSonic\nIt also belongs to collection: \n\nArtist/Composer: Michael Gregoire\nDate: 2007-04-11\nKeywords: rock; pop; electronica; trip-hop; hip-hop; post-rock; indie-rock\nCreative Commons license: Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0\n\n\nIndividual Files\nWhole Item\tFormat\tSize\n00-netBlocVol4.pdf.zip \tZIP \t21.3 MB \n\n00-netBlocVol4_192Kbs_MP3.zip \tZIP \t64.0 MB \n\n00-netBlocVol4_320Kbs_MP3.zip \tZIP \t95.8 MB \n\n00-netBlocVol4_Art_EPS_Format.zip \tZIP \t93.2 MB \n\n00-netBlocVol4_Art_PDF_Format.zip \tZIP \t79.8 MB \n\n00-netBlocVol4_Art_TIF_Format.zip \tZIP \t24.3 MB \n\n00-netBlocVol4_FLAC.zip \tZIP \t259.2 MB \n\n00-netBlocVol4_OGG.zip \tZIP \t124.4 MB \n\nBSCOMP0004_64kb.m3u \t64Kbps M3U \tStream \n\nBSCOMP0004_64kb_mp3.zip \t64Kbps MP3 ZIP \t20.5 MB \n\nBSCOMP0004_vbr.m3u \tVBR M3U \tStream \n\nBSCOMP0004_vbr_mp3.zip \tVBR ZIP \t56.9 MB \n\nAudio Files\tOgg Vorbis\t192Kbps MP3\t64Kbps MP3\tVBR MP3\n01 - Sun Zoo - New Pirates (featuring DJ HDL) \t2.3 MB \n5.6 MB \n1.8 MB \n3.6 MB \n\n02 - Maniax Memori - It's Not Jazzz \t3.0 MB \n5.3 MB \n1.7 MB \n4.5 MB \n\n03 - Dirge - Phone \t2.7 MB \n5.6 MB \n1.8 MB \n4.7 MB \n\n04 - deutscheunschuld - Just One Night (Du-Remix Edit) (Featuring Vocals by Jeremy Carr) \t3.5 MB \n7.0 MB \n2.3 MB \n4.8 MB \n\n05 - You Are My Everything - Can You Feel What It Takes? \t2.4 MB \n4.3 MB \n1.3 MB \n4.3 MB \n\n06 - Bersarin Quartett - St. Petersburg \t4.4 MB \n7.6 MB \n2.4 MB \n8.3 MB \n\n07 - Lucas CK - Tu cries \t3.7 MB \n6.9 MB \n2.2 MB \n6.3 MB \n\n08 - Crepusculum - A Sheltered Life (Herzog Reprise) \t3.5 MB \n6.5 MB \n2.1 MB \n6.8 MB \n\n09 - BSK - October \t4.1 MB \n7.8 MB \n2.5 MB \n6.8 MB \n\n10 - L'Onomatopeur - Pour Petite Tete \t4.1 MB \n7.6 MB \n2.4 MB \n6.9 MB \n\nImage Files\tJPEG\nBSCOMP0004.jpg \t285.2 KB \n\nInformation\tFormat\tSize\nBSCOMP0004_files.xml \tMetadata \t[file] \n\nBSCOMP0004_meta.xml \tMetadata \t2.3 KB \n\nBSCOMP0004_reviews.xml \tMetadata \t174.0 B\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16c6f48781aa107ae1d4b07775bb5b1e7464d9c1","amp;dn":"%5BBSCOMP0004%5D+netBloc+Vol.+4+Soundtrack+for+the+Coming+Revolution","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16c6f48781aa107ae1d4b07775bb5b1e7464d9c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,198,244,135,129,170,16,122,225,212,176,119,117,187,91,30,116,100,217,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
