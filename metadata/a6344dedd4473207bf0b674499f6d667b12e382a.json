What makes him original is the dark set setting combined with the unsuspecting attitude to social issues. The Church has long had a dominant influence in Irish life and here the dark side is explored. . .\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6344dedd4473207bf0b674499f6d667b12e382a","amp;dn":"JT+05.THE+PRIEST.Ken+Bruen.mb4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6344dedd4473207bf0b674499f6d667b12e382a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,52,77,237,212,71,50,7,191,11,103,68,153,246,214,103,177,46,56,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
