Thirty year old Lily Ireland is making  \n a Insalata Caprese for the new and much older man in    \n her life; a photo journalist, born and raised in Spain  \n named Michael, who she couldn't be more excited about.  \n In the apartment just across the courtyard, a very      \n pregnant Shelly Hynd is making her best attempt at      \n Lasagna, while her husband Chris looks on, knowing he   \n is moments away from ordering a Pizza...and when he     \n does, the highly hormonal Shelly is out the door and    \n straight up the stairs to her friend Jude's house for   \n some comfort. Shelly finds her friend lost in her       \n passion, and just beginning an elaborate Italian meal   \n for she and her lover, Celia, whom they both know won't \n make it home in time. And finally, there is the         \n culinary extravaganza being prepared in front of Celia, \n who works on a movie set, where on that particular day, \n they are shooting a couple cooking, while the crew      \n devours pizza on the side-line. Over the course of the  \n evening, all of the cooks and the guests of the         \n kitchen, truly experience why it is called &quot;The heart   \n of the house.&quot; The discussions organically flow to a    \n place where they are all about relationships, and they  \n are all about truth, and desire, and no one is allowed  \n off the hook about all that they are not saying amidst  \n their words. Lily and Michael dance around what they    \n want in life as they dance around the kitchen in a      \n seductive and emotional game, that never even allows    \n them to make it to the dining table. As Shelly unloads  \n all of her fears of motherhood and the future of her    \n marriage, Jude's acceptance and knowledge of Celia's    \n infidelity rises to the surface without a word being    \n said between the bruschetta and the cannoli. All the    \n while, Chris has settled into an evening of Pizza and   \n Adult Entertainment on DVD, and Celia has decided to    \n reel in a young actress curious about lesbians, just    \n for sport. ...And in the end, there is no resolution,   \n but there is hope, and there is love, and there is      \n life, unveiled and unapologetic in La Cucina.           \n                                                         \n\n\n\n\n  C A S T  \n\n\n                                                         \n                                                         \n       Christina Hendricks ...
