We got to dig again underground... in the darkness... where strange haunting ghosts prowl, singing strange tunes and... Lo! There's music again...\n\nA lot of bands you haven't probably heard about before. Old artists still playing and new young ones with their ideas and skills.\n\nProgressive rock music in all the declensions which are spelled today...\nThe progarchives.com site enumerates them like this:\ncrossover prog = cp\neclectic prog = ep\nheavy prog = hp\njazz rock fusion = jrf\nneo prog = np\nprogressive metal = pm\nrio avantprog = rio\nrock progressivo italiano = rpi\nsymphonic prog = sp\n\nSo now you have it: a collection of more or less 88 albums, giving you a partial insight of the contemporary progressive music in Italy...\nIt's incomplete of course... We weren't often able to find discographies for these bands ('cause it's almost impossible to find them online and also to buy them in several cases :P )\nAlso, we didn't want to build a torrent too big and difficult to share. \nProbably in the near future we will post the Revenants 2 with new material we are finding and organizing now...\n\nMeanwhile, dig this ghostly &quot;review&quot;...\n\nAll the album are zipped (since the number of files was too high for TPB).\nThe sampling rate is 320kbps when possible.\nDifferent rates are signed in the name of the albums zips.\n\nEnjoy :)\n\n\n(browse all my torrents:\n        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\nfor private posts:\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=113028&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=113028&lt;/a&gt;\n\n)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1b47a71d9da5fa2818f1bda2d4d000eefd56c4e","amp;dn":"progressive+-+Indiana+Jones+And+The+Revenants+of+Italy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1b47a71d9da5fa2818f1bda2d4d000eefd56c4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,180,122,113,217,218,95,162,129,143,27,218,45,77,0,14,239,213,108,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
