Disc one gets off to such a drab start you'll have to look twice at the cover to make sure this is Oakie and not some generic rip-off trance compilation. It's a hectic but drop-dead-dull start, but come &quot;Clear Blue,&quot; things get much better. Markus Schulz's &quot;Clear Blue&quot; is as vivid as its name and the following Carlos Vives track is a delicious combination of worldbeat chant and dancefloor drama. Things go back to safe for a little bit till our DJ gets quirky again and ends the first disc with some excitement. Front to back, disc two is much more successful. Oakenfold discovers breaks, bleeps, and bloops for the first part of the set, works steadily up to his epic U2 remix, and exits with a couple reliable stompers. There are thrills but few surprises from this one-time maverick, but if Oakie is trying to sonically reproduce the massive size of a Creamfields' event, he's done it. Skip past the lackluster kickoff and think film composer John Williams as a DJ with a wicked haircut.\nAll Music Review by David Jeffries  \n\n\n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] Point Zero - - - Matt Darey Presents Li Kwan\n[02] I Found U - - - Interstate\n[03] First Sight - - - Duran &amp; Aytek\n[04] Wadi - - - Sultan &amp; The Greek\n[05] Clear Blue - - - Markus Schulz Presents Elevation\n[06] Como Tu (Paul Oakenfold Mix) - - - Carlos Vives\n[07] 12 - - - Tilt\n[08] Living The Dream - - - D:Fuse\n[09] Space Manoeuvres Part 3 - - - Quivver\n[10] The World Doesn't Know - - - Tilt\n[11] Jump The Next Train (Probspot Remix) - - - Young Parisians Featuring Ben Lost\n\nCD01 Play Time - 01h:09m:04s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Ocean Of Love - - - Suzy Solar\n[02] One Day - - - NuBreed &amp; Luke Chable\n[03] Nice Guys Finish Last - - - Pinkbox Special\n[04] Cages (Lemon8 Mix) - - - Girl Nobody\n[05] Scatterbomb (Original String Mix) - - - The Sneaker\n[06] Perfect Wave - - - Peter Martin Presents Anthanasia\n[07] Time Of Your Life (Shane 54 Mix) - - - Paul Oakenfold Featuring Perry Farrell\n[08] People Want To Be Needed - - - The Auranaut\n[09] Particle - - - Stel &amp; Good Newz\n[10] Beautiful Day (Paul Oakenfold 2004 Remix) - - - U2\n[11] Lizard (Paul Oakenfold 2004 Remix) - - -  Mauro Picotto\n[12] I'm Not Fooled (J00F Tranced Out Mix) - - - John &quot;00&quot; Fleming\n\nCD02 Play Time - 01h:09m:09s\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 02h:18m:13s:\nTotal File Size....................... 328mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
