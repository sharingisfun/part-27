The legendary Ape-Man has claimed his title as Lord of Greystoke, but his very life is threatened when a hunting excursion with his fellow &quot;gentlemen&quot; goes disastrously wrong. Meanwhile, on Mars, John Carter is forced to respond to a veiled threat from his defeated enemies. Mars and Earth might be separated by millions of miles, but a sinister force is at work on both planets, setting the two champions on a deadly collision course. It all starts with Lords of Mars #1: The Hunting Party. Set phasers for &quot;mayhem&quot;!\n\nLords of Mars #2\nLord Greystoke and Jane find themselves transported to Mars, where they learn of a terrible tyrant named John Carter who has enslaved the dying planet. The Ape-Man's newfound &quot;friends&quot; are putting on an elaborate deception, but to what end? John Carter, meanwhile, deals with the sinister machinations of a strange new cult... devoted to none other than him!\n\nLords of Mars #3\nAt long last, the Lord of the Jungle and the Warlord of Mars meet... head on! A furious battle turns into a desperate two-man stand against the evil forces that have manipulated the ape-man into hating John Carter. No one, not even pulp fiction's greatest heroes can stand against a hundred of the terrible white apes of Mars. Fortunately, our adventures have a secret weapon: their wives!\n\nThanks goes to Pudgy for this release.\n\nDon't know how to view this comic book?
