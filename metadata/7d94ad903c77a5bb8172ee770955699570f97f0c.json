Author Mark Millar created the comic with the premise &quot;what if Superman had been raised in the Soviet Union?&quot; It received critical acclaim and was nominated for the 2004 Eisner Award for best limited series.\n\nThe story mixes alternate versions of DC super-heroes with alternate-reality versions of real political figures such as Joseph Stalin and John F. Kennedy. The series spans approximately 1953-2001, save for a futuristic epilogue.\n\nIn Red Son, Superman's rocket ship lands on a Ukrainian collective farm rather than in Kansas, an implied reason being a small time difference (a handful of hours) from the original timeline, meaning Earth's rotation placed the Ukraine in the ship's path instead of Kansas. Instead of fighting for &quot;...truth, justice, and the American Way&quot;, Superman is described in Soviet radio broadcasts &quot;...as the Champion of the common worker who fights a never-ending battle for Stalin, socialism, and the international expansion of the Warsaw Pact.&quot; His &quot;secret identity&quot; (i.e. the name his adoptive parents gave him) is a state secret.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman:_Red_Son&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman:_Red_Son&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/superman-red-son/49-10943/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/superman-red-son/49-10943/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d94ad903c77a5bb8172ee770955699570f97f0c","amp;dn":"Superman%3A+Red+Son+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d94ad903c77a5bb8172ee770955699570f97f0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,148,173,144,60,119,165,187,129,114,238,119,9,85,105,149,112,249,127,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
