The DVD will become useable\nto your windows operating system and all programs on your computer, such as DVD-Backup-software\nlike CloneDVD, Pinnacle InstantCopy, Intervideo DVDCopy and others, then supporting any DVD.\nAnyDVD optionally disables the RPC region codes, thereby making the movie region\nfree and comfortably viewable on any DVD player and with any DVD player software.\n \nAnyDVD is capable of disabling unwanted movie features such as forced subtitles, forced delays,\nand no-skip marks, giving you full control over your movie experience. It also allows you to launch an\nexternal application whenever you insert or remove a disc, and prevents unwanted software\nlike 'PC-friendly' from automatically launching when you insert a video DVD.\n \nYou can control the drive speed of your DVD drive, allowing you to reduce the noise level when watching\nmovies on your PC. You can even adjust the display frequency of your monitor for both NTSC and PAL displays.\n \nBut AnyDVD doesn't just stop at DVDs, it also fixes intentionally broken audio CDs to allow you to play and use them.\n \n \n \n \nAnyDVD HD comes with the same functionality as AnyDVD, but with additional features\nfor full Blu-ray and HD DVD support, including Blu-ray and HD DVD movies.\n \nAllows you to watch movies over a digital display connection, without HDCP-compliant graphics card\nand without HDCP-compliant display.
