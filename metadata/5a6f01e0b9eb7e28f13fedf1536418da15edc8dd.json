SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tried to focus on her responsibilities - training Quentin, upholding her position as SylvesterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s knight, and paying the bills - but she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help feeling like her world is crumbling around her, and her increasingly reckless behavior is beginning to worry even her staunchest supporters.\n\nTo make matters worse, TobyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just been asked to find another missing childÃ¢â‚¬Â¦only this time itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the changeling daughter of her fellow knight, Etienne, who didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even know he was a father until the girl went missing. Her name is Chelsea. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a teleporter, like her father. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also the kind of changeling the old stories warn about, the ones with all the strength and none of the control. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s opening doors that were never meant to be opened, releasing dangers that were sealed away centuries before - and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a good chance she could destroy Faerie if she isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stopped.\n\nNow Toby must find Chelsea before time runs out, racing against an unknown deadline and through unknown worlds as she and her allies try to avert disaster. But danger is also stirring in the Court of Cats, and Tybalt may need TobyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s help with the biggest challenge heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever faced.\n\nToby thought the last year was bad. She has no idea","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a6f01e0b9eb7e28f13fedf1536418da15edc8dd","amp;dn":"Ashes+of+Honor+-+Seanan+McGuire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a6f01e0b9eb7e28f13fedf1536418da15edc8dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,111,1,224,185,235,126,40,241,63,237,241,83,100,24,218,21,237,200,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
