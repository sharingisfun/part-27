Not too surprising really since like other Wast Coast shipyard cities it was the home for many black migrants from the South. This subculture surfaced in the 1970's thanks to the efforts of folklorist and music store owner Lou Curtiss. Thomas Shaw is the best known of San Diego performers and worked with Lou in tracing most of the other fine musicians on this collection. These recordings, made in the early 70's, are varied including country blues, piano blues, electric blues and even a calypso! Most of the artists featured have now passed on or have retired from music though Tom 'Tomcat' Courtney continues to delight club goers in San Diego with his energetic brand of electric blues. Originally issued on Advent label in 1974, this album reissue features six previously unissued tracks.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f04d49bbf95b70664924e2eedabcfbc416a13ce9","amp;dn":"%28Blues+VA%29+San+Diego+Blues+Jam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f04d49bbf95b70664924e2eedabcfbc416a13ce9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,77,73,187,249,91,112,102,73,36,226,238,218,188,251,196,22,161,60,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
