When Master of the Jefferson Hunt ''Sister'' Jane Arnold is confronted with two ominously similar deaths, she begins to suspect that the killings are linked- and part of a much larger plot. \nVoicing her opinion soon puts Jane's life in danger. Fortunately, she can turn to her four-legged friends- including horses Keepsake and Lafayette, and even the fox Aunt Netty for help. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9fe531eefb67ca18260f54f2c7ae9f967590bfc","amp;dn":"Rita+Mae+Brown-Fox+Tracks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9fe531eefb67ca18260f54f2c7ae9f967590bfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,254,83,30,239,182,124,161,130,96,245,79,44,122,233,249,103,89,11,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
