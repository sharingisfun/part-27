They purchased the house for a really good price, but there was a catchâ€¦ the house doesnâ€™t have electricity, the wires are very old and need to be replaced.\r\n\r\nThe individual that bought the house has been working on some kind of hand crank generators for many months and now itâ€™s a great opportunity to test them out, he set 4 devices around the house, thatâ€™s all you have to rely for lighting during the night.\r\n\r\nThese devices had been pretty stable during the development, but there is something in the house thatâ€™s making them unstable. No matter what, donâ€™t let them run out of power, there is something hiding in the darkness!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5a91bb04f27f0793b0cb7fb911ccf91ca5ebd79","amp;dn":"Sophie%27s+Curse+v3.01","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5a91bb04f27f0793b0cb7fb911ccf91ca5ebd79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,169,27,176,79,39,240,121,59,12,183,251,145,28,207,145,202,94,189,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
