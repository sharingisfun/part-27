Women adored him and almost everyone who met this charismatic stranger was drawn to his charming innocence. But, Falls City&amp;#039;s hottest date and truest friend had one secret: he wasn&amp;#039;t the person people thought he was.\n\nBack home in Lincoln just seventy-five miles away, Brandon Teena was a different person caught up in a personal crisis that had haunted him his entire life.\n\nLike many young people, he made costly mistakes and when he inadvertently trespassed between his new love Lana (Chloe Sevigny) and her reckless friend John (Peter Sarsgaard), the mystery unraveled into violence.\n\nIn a single, short life Brandon Teena was at once a dashing lover and a trapped outsider, both an impoverished nobody and a flamboyant dreamer, a daring thief and the tragic victim of an unjust crime.\n\nBoys Don&amp;#039;t Cry explores the contradictions of American youth and identity through the true life and death of Brandon Teena. What emerges from a dust-cloud of mayhem, desire and murder is the story of a young American drifter searching for love, a sense of self and a place to call home.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0171804/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0171804/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e76e519a349f6c264f91202296f944b529e99c6a","amp;dn":"Boys+Don%5C%27t+Cry+Full+Dvd+Spa-Eng+Pal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e76e519a349f6c264f91202296f944b529e99c6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,110,81,154,52,159,108,38,79,145,32,34,150,249,68,181,41,233,156,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
