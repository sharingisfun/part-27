Quarks come in different types. There are six different types: up, down, charm, strange, top and bottom. For example, a proton is comprised of two up quarks and one down quark. Quarks have electric charge, color charge, spin and mass. But they have no internal structure, they behave like mathematical points.\n\nElectrons are members of the lepton family. Like the quarks, leptons are also point particles. \n\nContent: Craig.Ferguson.2010.04.06.Mindy.Kaling.H264[quark].mp4\n                Size: 44,794,558 bytes (42.719 MB)\n                Play duration: 00:40:03 (2403.45 s)\n                Container type: MP4/MOV\n\n         The.Colbert.Report.2010.04.06.Rev.Al.Sharpton.H264[quark].mp4\n                Size: 24,010,432 bytes (22.898 MB)\n                Play duration: 00:21:29 (1289.263333 s)\n               Container type: MP4/MOV\n\n         The.Daily.Show.2010.04.06.Capt.Richard.Phillips.H264[quark].mp4\n               Size: 24,031,700 bytes (22.918 MB)\n               Play duration: 00:21:30 (1289.728333 s)\n               Container type: MP4/MOV\n\nMajor brand: ISO Base Media version 1\nCompatible brands: JVT AVC\nCreation time: 6/04/2010 15:53:27 UTC\nModification time: 6/04/2010 15:53:27 UTC\nNumber of streams: 2\nType of stream nr. 1: audio (AAC Low complexity) {GPAC ISO Audio Handler}\nType of stream nr. 2: video (avc1) {GPAC ISO Video Handler}\nVideo Codec: avc1\nResolution: 352 x 192\nDisplay aspect ratio: 341:192 = 1.776041 (~16:9)\nFramerate: 29.970029 fps\nBitrate: 131.527908 kbps\nAudio Codec: AAC Low complexity\nBitrate: 16.110460 kbps\nChannels: 1\nSample rate: 11025 Hz\n\nDownload whole package or just ones you want.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39d65427693ed6d2f00b1d8b0e91ad3f4f06eb45","amp;dn":"Talk.Shows.Pack.2010.04.06%28Craig.Daily.Colbert%29.H264%5Bquark%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39d65427693ed6d2f00b1d8b0e91ad3f4f06eb45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,214,84,39,105,62,214,210,240,11,29,139,14,145,173,63,79,6,235,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
