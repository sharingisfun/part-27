Having been famous is not. More than ten years ago Johnny Yamamoto and his giant robot Titanzer defeated some aliens invading our world. Now he can barely defeat a burrito with his credit card. But this isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t some mope opera, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an action comedy about getting your crap together when life punches you down, around, and into a building. Put a smile on that bloody face and learn a bit about Johnny and his giant robot in the twice a week webcomic Titanzer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70f58d86379bd37ae65dd8a9b36155f79decbf12","amp;dn":"Giant+Robot+Indie+Comic+-+Titanzer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70f58d86379bd37ae65dd8a9b36155f79decbf12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,245,141,134,55,155,211,122,230,93,216,169,179,97,85,247,157,236,191,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
