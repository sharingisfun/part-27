The\nplan is driven by a longer-term vision, goals and results to 2017, and it will be\nreviewed in 2013. In line with the results frameworks of other United Nations\norganizations, the UN-Women unified results framework contains three interrelated\ncomponents: (a) a development results framework, (b) a management results\nframework, and (c) an integrated resources framework.\n\n__The development results framework comprises six main goals, each supported\nby defined outcomes, targets and indicators. Central to the realization of these goals is the coordination and support role of UN-Women within the United Nations\nsystem. The goals are: (a) to increase womenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s leadership and participation in all\nareas that affect their lives; (b) to increase womenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s access to economic\nempowerment and opportunities, especially for those who are most excluded; (c) to\nprevent violence against women and girls and expand access to survivor services;\n\n\n* UNW/2011/L.2.\n** While this first strategic plan covers the period from 2011-2013, it is driven by a longer-term vision, goals and results to 2017 and will be assessed and revised in 2013 in order to align with the planning cycles of other United Nations agencies, funds and programmes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f704e9172d96d72df6d0de3ffe5c6d9c010551da","amp;dn":"UN+Women+Empowerment+Plan+2011-2013+%5Bkot%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f704e9172d96d72df6d0de3ffe5c6d9c010551da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,4,233,23,45,150,215,45,246,208,222,63,254,92,109,156,1,5,81,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
