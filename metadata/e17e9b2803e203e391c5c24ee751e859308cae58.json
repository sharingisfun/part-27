In the 15th century when it began to refer to a people ditinguished by their own tongue and customs who formed separate communities. These strong, free Cossack communities were seen as a threat to the Tsar until in 1671 they were obliged to swear fealty. From that date onwards Cossacks served in all of RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wars, most famously when 50,000 Don Cossacks fought against Napoleon of which nearly half died in battle or on campaign.
