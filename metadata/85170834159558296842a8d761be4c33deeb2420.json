In contrast to the later Lee Michaels' recordings the Carnival Of Life LP is simply a full-blown psychedelic (pop) rock based on heavy Hammond organ sounds; massively charming harpsichord notes; fuzz-laden guitar parts (by the Euphoria member); very solid and busy drumming (by Eddie Hoh); catchy, Beatles-like melodies; memorable hooks and (last but not least) very clear baroque-pop influences. This awesome record is absolutely recommended - even in a first glance an average cover might discourage some listeners... The sound of that remastered CD is just gorgeous - much better and cleaner than previous, very noisy and muddy editon.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85170834159558296842a8d761be4c33deeb2420","amp;dn":"Lee+Michaels+-+Carnival+Of+Life+%281968%2F2010%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85170834159558296842a8d761be4c33deeb2420","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,23,8,52,21,149,88,41,104,66,168,215,97,190,76,51,222,235,36,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
