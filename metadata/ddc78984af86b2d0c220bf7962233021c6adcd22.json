Since they don't have a television in the living room or family room, this is where they like to gather with their 3 Dobermans, friends and family to watch movies and read. William wants the room to have a better sound system for all the films he watches and music he likes to listen to.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 13-Nov-2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddc78984af86b2d0c220bf7962233021c6adcd22","amp;dn":"The.Shatner.Project.S01E05.WS.DSR.x264-NY2.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddc78984af86b2d0c220bf7962233021c6adcd22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,199,137,132,175,134,178,208,194,32,191,121,98,35,48,33,198,173,205,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
