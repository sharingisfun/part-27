Born in the village of Resembool from the country of Amestris (ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¹ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‹â€ ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚ÂªÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¹ ,Amesutorisu?), the two brothers lived there with their parents. Their father, Hohenheim, left home for unknown reasons and years later, their mother, Trisha Elric, died of a terminal illness leaving the Elric brothers alone. After their mother's death, Edward becomes determined to bring her back through the use of alchemy, an advanced science in which objects can be created from raw materials. They researched Human Transmutation, a forbidden art in which one attempts to create or modify a human being. However, this attempt failed, ultimately resulting in the loss of Edward's left leg and Alphonse's entire body. In a desperate effort to save his brother, Edward sacrificed his right arm to affix his brother's soul to a suit of armor. Some days later, an alchemist named Roy Mustang visits the Elric brothers, and he tells Edward to become a member of the State Military of the country to find a way to recover their bodies. After that, Edward's left leg and right arm are fitted with two sets of automail, a type of advanced prosthetic limb, created for him by his close family friends Winry Rockbell and her grandmother Pinako. Edward sets out to become a State Alchemist (ÃƒÂ¥Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃ‚Â½ÃƒÂ¥Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â¶ÃƒÂ©Ã…â€™Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ©Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒÂ¨Ã‚Â¡Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÂ¥Ã‚Â¸Ã‚Â« ,Kokka Renkinjutsushi?), an alchemist employed by the State Military of Amestris, which infamously annihilated much of the neighboring country of Ishbal's population in the past decade. Becoming a State Alchemist enables Edward to use the extensive resources available to State Alchemists, but it also turns him into what they call a &quot;dog of the military&quot;. His more friendly relationship with Roy Mustang however, whom he reports to and who recruited him, allows the brothers freedom to search for the Philosopher's Stone as part of Edward's research, as each State Alchemist is expected to independently research new things which may be of a use to the State Military of Amestris. The brothers set off in search of the Philosopher's Stone as a means to restore their bodies. Throughout their journey, they meet many antagonists, including those who are willing to do anything to obtain the Philosopher's Stone; Scar, one of the few surviving Ishbalans, who seeks vengeance on the State Alchemists for the destruction of his race; and the homunculi, a group of human-like creatures who carry pieces of the Philosopher's Stone inside themselves, and from it derive the ability to survive almost any harm. As the story progresses, Edward and Alphonse discover the vast expansion of Amestris was the result of the homunculi, who created and secretly control the State Military. The homunculi and much of the high-ranking military officers are commanded from behind the curtains by the creator of the homunculi, a man simply known as Father, who gained immortality by using a copy of Hohenheim as his new body centuries before the series' timeline. He plans to use Amestris as a gigantic transmutation circle and turn the entire country into a Philosopher's Stone. When Edward and Alphonse discover Father's plans, they set out to defeat him along with other members of the State Military.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdc85e19b3a82b8e351a37973282b58d7a995cfe","amp;dn":"%5BTaka%5D+Fullmetal+Alchemist+%282009%29+01+%5B480p%5D%5B884ADFC3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdc85e19b3a82b8e351a37973282b58d7a995cfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,200,94,25,179,168,43,142,53,26,55,151,50,130,181,141,122,153,92,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
