Reminiscent of Bill CosbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fatherhood, Dad is Fat is sharply observed, explosively funny, and a cry for help from a man who has realized he and his wife are outnumbered in their own home.\n\nUploaded by ethfun.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b514e84b9989677c1ebca634314cea9b294568bc","amp;dn":"Dad+is+Fat+-+Jim+Gaffigan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b514e84b9989677c1ebca634314cea9b294568bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,20,232,75,153,137,103,124,30,188,166,52,49,76,234,155,41,69,104,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
