League of Gentlemen and Victim are on TPB, here is the 3rd of the 4.\n\nThe film examines racial attitudes in 1950s London within the framework of a classic murder mystery and detective story. A lot of hypocrisy is buried under the veneer of civilized society...\n\nI copped this from youtube, I thought I'd put it here in case they take it down. It's in flv format, I put it in a folder because TPB classes flv movies as video clips. It plays nicely on VLC, convert it to another format if you wish to burn it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4227bb86f4c27b2847be8bc51b3bb62bd748214c","amp;dn":"Sapphire+%281959%29+Basil+Dearden","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4227bb86f4c27b2847be8bc51b3bb62bd748214c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,39,187,134,244,194,123,40,71,190,139,197,27,59,182,43,215,72,33,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
