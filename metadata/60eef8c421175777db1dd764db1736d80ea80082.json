It soon deepens into an affecting portrait of a family trying desperately to hold onto itself and the memory of a daughter whose return becomes increasingly unlikely. Stark and honest, this is an intimate account of what happens behind the headlines of a very American tragedy.\n\nViking Adult | English | October 30, 2008 | ISBN: 067002032X | 320 pages | azw, epub, lrf, mobi | 3,6 mb\n\nEditorial Reviews\nFrom Publishers Weekly\nStarred Review. O'Nan proves that uncertainty can be the worst punishment of all in this unflinching look at an unraveling family. In the small town of Kingsville, Ohio, 18-year-old Kim LarsenÃ¢â‚¬â€popular and bound for college in the fallÃ¢â‚¬â€disappears on her way to work one afternoon. Not until the next morning do her parents, Ed and Fran, and 15-year-old sister, Lindsay, realize Kim is missing. The lead detective on the case tells the Larsens that since Kim is an adult, she could, if the police find her, ask that the police not disclose her location to her parents. When Kim's car later turns up in nearby Sandusky, Ed, desperate to help, joins the official search. Meanwhile, Fran stays home putting all her energy into community fund-raisers, and Lindsay struggles to maintain a normal life. Through shifting points of view, chiefly those of the shell-shocked parents and the moody Lindsay, O'Nan raises the suspense while conveying the sheer torture of what it's like not to know what has happened to a loved one. WhenÃ¢â‚¬â€if everÃ¢â‚¬â€do you stop looking? 6-city author tour. (Nov.)\nCopyright Ã‚Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\nFrom Bookmarks Magazine\nStewart O'Nan has quietly written his way to the top rank of American novelists working today, and Songs for the Missing showcases his skill for molding character-driven novels remarkable for their clarity of vision and an unflinching eye for situations that lay bare human emotion. There is little spectacular here, save for O'Nan's storytelling abilities and his uncanny knowledge of how one event can send out ripples that affect everyone in a small Midwestern town (incidentally, the author's old stomping grounds). Even more satisfying and heartbreaking is O'Nan's understanding of what happens when the lights dim, attention fades, and people are left to live their lives.\nCopyright 2008 Bookmarks Publishing LLC \n\nMore About the Author\nBiography\nStewart O'Nan's award-winning fiction includes Snow Angels, A Prayer for the Dying, Last Night at the Lobster, and Emily, Alone.
