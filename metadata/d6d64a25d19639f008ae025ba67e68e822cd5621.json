The bluesy &quot;Of the Girl&quot; starts the show, and is one of five tunes from Binaural in the set, including &quot;Grievance,&quot; &quot;Light Years,&quot; &quot;Insignificance,&quot; and the first live performance of &quot;Sleight of Hand&quot; during the encore. The encore, despite what sounds to be a briefly dropped drumstick during &quot;Black&quot; and a noticeable lack of any bass in &quot;Evolution,&quot; is one of the best the band has done, mixing crowd-pleasing favorites with an obscure cover like &quot;Timeless Melody&quot; by power pop one-hit wonders the La's. Whether the crowd is inspired by the excellent performance or the band is responding to the enthusiastic crowd, Vedder proclaims that &quot;so far, this is the best crowd,&quot; a compliment he doles out infrequently. --Adem Tepedelen\n\n\n\nThis live show proves that the band are quite the juggernaut when it comes \nto the live arena. Over the 27 tracks Matt Cameron shows that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the right man for the drummerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seat. Where Abruezze was sloppy, Cameron is a steamroller. Where Jack Irons was stiff, Cameron is loose. Tracks like the radio-worn &quot;Alive&quot; have incredible new life breathed into them in the concert hall, and you can feel the emotion of the crowd heighten when the band rolls out powerful versions of &quot;Wishlist&quot; and &quot;Given To Fly.&quot; Vedder is most affective when heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s almost at the end of his throat-tearing rope, as heard on the ferocious &quot;Habit.&quot; Mike McreadyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more than large encore nod to Jimi Hendrix with &quot;Yellow Ledbetter&quot; sends the crowd home wishing that this show had never ended.
