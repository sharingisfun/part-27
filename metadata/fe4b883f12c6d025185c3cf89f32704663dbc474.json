The duo added Brian Campbell and Carl Turney to the fold and released the thrashy debut single IPC Sub-Editors Dictate Our Youth on the group's own Aladdin's Cave of Golf label; it reached number nine in John Peel's Festive 50 singles roundup that year. 1998 saw the release of equally well-received singles like &quot;Cement Mixer&quot; and &quot;Monkey on My Back,&quot; which also showcased Clinic's blend of chugging, Velvet Underground-style guitars, icy, Suicide-esque keyboards and drum machines, and Blackburn's acidic, Lennon-esque vocals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe4b883f12c6d025185c3cf89f32704663dbc474","amp;dn":"Clinic+-+Free+Reign+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe4b883f12c6d025185c3cf89f32704663dbc474","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,75,136,63,18,198,208,37,24,92,60,248,159,50,112,70,99,219,196,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
