It has recently been ported to the PSP, as part of Crazy Taxi: Fare Wars. It has a host of new features over the original, including two new cities, \\&quot;Around Apple\\&quot; and \\&quot;Small Apple\\&quot;, both somewhat based on New York City. The new cities have four new drivers as default, and you can also play as the drivers from the first game, bringing the total to eight. One gameplay addition is multiple pickups, which enable the player to carry multiple passengers and bring them to different locations. The draw to multiple pickups is that all trick-based tip amounts are multiplied by the amount of passengers in the car. A downside is that their time requirements are often more difficult than regular pickups. This game also implements a new \\&quot;Crazy Hop\\&quot; feature, which allows the player to jump over certain surfaces to save time. This sequel includes a modified soundtrack with rock bands The Offspring and Methods of Mayhem. There is an internet-based highscore board, and a replay ability. One of the most unusual aspects of the game is the \\&quot;Crazy Pyramid\\&quot;, which features minigames including:\n\n    * Crazy Jump 2\n    * Crazy Golf\n    * Crazy Hurdle\n    * Crazy 3-Jump\n    * Crazy Balloons 2\n    * Crazy Ramps\n    * Crazy Road\n    * Crazy Turn 2\n    * Crazy Jam 2\n    * Crazy Rush 2\n    * Crazy Drop\n    * Crazy Stairs\n    * Crazy Zigzag 3\n    * Crazy Arches","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:170b38fc1a5a03d303288901d0a7544d3414e64c","amp;dn":"Crazy+Taxi+2%28www.dc-scene.net%29.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"170b38fc1a5a03d303288901d0a7544d3414e64c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,11,56,252,26,90,3,211,3,40,137,1,208,167,84,77,52,20,230,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
