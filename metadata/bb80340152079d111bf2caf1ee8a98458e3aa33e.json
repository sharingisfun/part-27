Their members were Razorsharp, Channelman, Hacker (a.k.a. Hackrat), Mega-Biter, and Output.  After an attempt to hack into the Wayne Foundation's satellite system, they were stopped by Robin, but managed to get away.  After reporting their failure to their boss he tried to kill them all, but only got Mega-Biter and Output.  Razorsharp and Channelman were attacked by Venev, one of the Bloodlines parasites, giving them superpowers. \nRazorsharp found she could transform her limbs into blades which could cut through almost anything.  Channelman's essence became trapped within television and he can change channels and manipulate TV broadcasts.  After gaining their powers the Psyba-Rats found that acting on the right side of the law can be fun, and have done so from time to time since then.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb80340152079d111bf2caf1ee8a98458e3aa33e","amp;dn":"Psyba-Rats+%28DC+Comics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb80340152079d111bf2caf1ee8a98458e3aa33e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,128,52,1,82,7,157,17,27,242,202,241,238,138,152,69,142,58,163,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
