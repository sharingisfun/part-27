More advanced passwords with numbers and characters takes longer.\n\nThe main purpose of the LCP program is user account passwords auditing and recovery in Windows NT/2000/XP.\n\nHow it works:\n\nWindows NT, 2000 and XP passwords are stored as encrypted hashes. LC5 attacks these hashes with hundreds of passwords per minute.\n\nEventually the correct password will be sent and then displayed to the screen.\n\nGood intentions:\n\n    * System administrators can find weak passwords within minutes. Sys admins can then change the passwords to make them more secure.\n    * LC5 can be used to access computers of users who forget passwords.\n    * In companies, it can be used to access computers of employees who have left the company.\n\nBad intentions: may be your intentions\n\n    * Hackers can use LC5 to sniff passwords over networks.\n    * Hackers can install this application onto a primary domain controller and steal hundreds of passwords within minutes.\n\nPlease note that I am not the author of this software.
