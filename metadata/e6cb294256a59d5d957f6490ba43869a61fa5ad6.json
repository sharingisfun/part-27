As with the first alpha, only Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Ubuntu GNOME and Ubuntu Kylin have opted to release CD/DVD images for testing. From the release announcement: &quot;The second alpha of the Utopic Unicorn (to become 14.10) has now been released. This alpha features images for Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Ubuntu GNOME, Ubuntu Kylin and the Ubuntu Cloud images. Alpha 2 includes a number of software updates that are ready for wider testing. This is quite an early set of images, so you should expect some bugs. A big thank you to the developers and testers for their efforts to pull together this alpha release!&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6cb294256a59d5d957f6490ba43869a61fa5ad6","amp;dn":"Kubuntu+14.04.1+64-bit+maintenance+update","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6cb294256a59d5d957f6490ba43869a61fa5ad6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,203,41,66,86,165,157,93,149,127,100,144,186,67,134,154,97,250,90,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
