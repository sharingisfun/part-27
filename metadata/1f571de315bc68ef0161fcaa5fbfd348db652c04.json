Some real heat on here in .flac format so you can bump it like a real G, or, in my case, via the FM radio waves in Virginia, (still like a real G)... I think maybe I appreciate lossless quality more than most but at least I'm ranting about it.\n\n\nOn Last FM: Gang Starr was an influential American hip-hop duo, composed of late rapper Guru (Backronym for Gifted Unlimited Rhymes Universal, real name Keith Elam) and DJ Premier (real name Chris Martin). Premier originally from Houston and Guru from Boston, but they were based in and represented Brooklyn, New York, epitomizing the New York City hip-hop sound.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f571de315bc68ef0161fcaa5fbfd348db652c04","amp;dn":"Gang+Starr+Full+Clip+-+A+Decade+of+Gang+Starr+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f571de315bc68ef0161fcaa5fbfd348db652c04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,87,29,227,21,188,104,239,1,97,252,170,95,191,211,72,219,101,44,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
