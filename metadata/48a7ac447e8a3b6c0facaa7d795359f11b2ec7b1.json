Now the familiar tale takes on new life, fresh meaning, and an unexpected setting. Hunted like an animal by Norman invaders, Bran ap Brychan, heir to the throne Elfael, has abandoned his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kingdom and fled to the greenwood. There, in the primeval forest of the Welsh borders, danger surrounds him Ã¢â‚¬â€œ for this woodland is a living, breathing entity with mysterious powers and secrets, and Bran must find a way to make it his own if he is to survive. Like the forest itself, Hood is deep, dark, and at times savagely brutal Ã¢â‚¬â€œ yet full of enchantment and hope.\n\n\nBook: 2\n\nAfter losing everything he owns, forester Will Scarlet embarks on a search for none other than King Raven, whose exploits have already become legendary. After fulfilling his quest-and proving himself a skilled and loyal companion-Will joins the heroic archer and his men. Now, however, Will is in prison for a crime he did not commit. His sentence is death by hanging-unless he delivers King Raven and his band of cohorts. That, of course, he will never do.\n\n\nBook: 3\n\nAs King Raven, Bran is Lord of the Forest. But his true crown seems out of reach. Bran is still fighting to bring his people justice from the shadows of the green wood. But Abbot Hugo is used to playing the long game and has been watching and learning. Abbot Hugo plans to bring the invading Norman marchogi to the forest in force, heralding the start of a campaign to wipe out King Raven and his band once and for all. Their merciless attack, the first of many, marks a dark day for the realm. And the dream of seeing a true king take the throne of Elfael seems increasingly remote. Bran and his few stalwarts desperately need encouragement and reinforcement if they are to survive. But Friar Tuck, a most unconventional priest, may just have a solution to their dilemma.\n\n\n\nHappy Listening :)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48a7ac447e8a3b6c0facaa7d795359f11b2ec7b1","amp;dn":"Stephen+R.+Lawhead+-+The+King+Raven+Trilogy+%28+Complete+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48a7ac447e8a3b6c0facaa7d795359f11b2ec7b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,167,172,68,126,138,59,108,15,172,170,125,121,83,89,241,27,46,199,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
