Despite being diagnosed with the chronic intestinal illness Crohn&amp;#039;s disease at age 13, she developed a career as a dancer, appearing on Club MTV and in such music videos as Salt-N-Pepa&amp;#039;s &quot;Everybody Get Up&quot; and &quot;Twist and Shout.&quot; In 1999, she was a finalist on the MTV talent contest show The Cut, which attracted the interest of record labels. She signed to the Daylight custom label of Sony Music&amp;#039;s Epic Records and recorded her debut album, Not That Kind, which was released internationally in 2000.\nThe result was massive success: the album reached the Top Ten in eight European and Far East countries, selling over two million copies. At home, the single &quot;I&amp;#039;m Outta Love&quot; became a dance hit, paving the way for the release of a revised version of Not That Kind in the U.S. in March 2001. A year later, she was creating a buzz in America. She joined Mary J. Blige, Cher, Shakira, and others for VH1&amp;#039;s fifth annual Divas Live showcase in May 2002. She made her proper American debut with Freak of Nature in June. A self-titled album followed in 2004, with the compilation Pieces of a Dream: Best Of arriving a year later. After making a successful foray into fashion with her own clothing line in 2006, Anastacia returned to music in 2007 with plans to release a new album and tour in 2008. \n\nReview\tby William Ruhlmann\n\nAs revealed in the multiple pictures in the CD package and in the video featured as part of the disc&amp;#039;s multi-media content, Anastacia is, in appearance, yet another teen dream with cascades of blonde hair and an exposed navel (though perhaps her ever-present, and ever-changing, spectacles are supposed to signal a higher intellectual content). But her musical models aren&amp;#039;t Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, they are Aretha Franklin, Tina Turner, and Martha Wash. Anastacia possesses a big, expressive alto voice that her many co-writers and producers (primarily Rik Wake [Celine Dion, Mariah Carey] and the team of ex-Color Me Badd member Sam Watters and Louis Biancaniello, though Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers, authors of &amp;#039;N Sync&amp;#039;s &quot;God Must Have Spent a Little More Time on You,&quot; have two tracks) use in updated R&amp;B, dance, and funk tracks. &quot;I&amp;#039;m Outta Love,&quot; which just missed topping the dance charts, is an aggressive dancefloor item, and its follow-up, the title song, is in a funk style reminiscent of Aretha Franklin&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;80s work. &quot;I Ask of You&quot; is one of those slow, deliberate big ballads that recalls &quot;And I Am Telling You I&amp;#039;m Not Going&quot; as well as that song&amp;#039;s singer, Jennifer Holliday. And so it goes. The only real misstep on the album is the inevitable Diane Warren adult contemporary romantic ballad, &quot;Late Last Night,&quot; which forces the singer to rein in her voice, though even then she doesn&amp;#039;t really negotiate its lyrical complexity. Despite her toothsome appearance, Anastacia may be too old school to break through in the U.S., though this album has been a commercial success overseas. (The American version has been altered from the foreign one, with a couple of tracks added and dropped.) But Macy Gray demonstrated that a broad audience may respond to an older style if the singer herself is distinguished enough. Anastacia doesn&amp;#039;t have the kind of unique timbre that Gray does -- in fact, the minute she opens her mouth she starts reminding you of other singers, especially Aretha Franklin -- but she is clearly a big talent, and that should count for something.  \n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7bfbab8304da46ae3eba2a7a31b93abd0c001f8","amp;dn":"Anastacia+-++Not+That+Kind+-+%282000%29%5BMP3+VBR%5D.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7bfbab8304da46ae3eba2a7a31b93abd0c001f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,191,186,184,48,77,164,106,227,235,162,167,163,27,147,171,208,192,1,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
