The song peaked in the Top 10 of the Radio &amp; Records Country Singles chart in Canada and #76 on the Canadian Hot 100. It also reached the Top 30 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart in the United States.\n\nThe music video was directed by Stephen Scott, and has aired on CMT Pure Country.\n\n&quot;Brothers&quot; is a mid-tempo ballad describing the relationship between the narrator and his brother, who is a soldier. In the first verse, the narrator is reluctant to let his brother leave, offering to do anything that will keep him home. The two interact through letters in the second verse, with the narrator telling his brother how much he misses him. In the first two instances, the soldier brother reassures the narrator by saying &quot;this is what brothers are for&quot;. Finally, in the third verse, the soldier arrives home in a wheelchair. He apologizes to the narrator for having to be pushed home in it, and the narrator replies, &quot;this is what brothers are for.&quot;\n\nJim Malec of The 9513 gave the song a thumbs-up rating, saying &quot;'Brothers' veers widely from the standard radio formula in one very significant wayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½for a song that so pointedly references the times in which we live, it isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t particularly uplifting, nor does it resolve into a sound byte-worthy declaration of hopefulness.&quot; Roughstock critic Matt Bjorke described the song as &quot;a well-written story song by any measure&quot;, adding that it was &quot;heartening to see such a song score with radio.&quot; He added that his original review, written in October 2008, was negative in nature because at the time, he did not understand the song's context.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c438dc0dc99b27db4157f2a78809f6e68b9072b","amp;dn":"Dean+Brody+-+Brothers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c438dc0dc99b27db4157f2a78809f6e68b9072b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,67,141,192,220,153,178,125,180,21,127,42,120,128,159,110,104,185,7,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
