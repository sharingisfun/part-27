Stick Way Out Behind\n4. Can I Get a Witness\n5. When the Saints Go Marching In\n6. Take It Easy Greasy\n7. Slow Down Baby\n8. Bluebird Blues\n9. Hello Little Baby\n10. She Tried to Ruin Me\n11. My Baby's Too Sweet to Die\n12. Judgement Day\n\n\nPersonnel:\nSnooky Pryor - Harmonica, vocals\nIncludes Derek O'Brien, Hubert Sumlin, Luther Tucker, Jr. Watson on guitars, Pinetop Perkins on piano and many more.\n\nSee included scan for individual track credits.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24bf3ac5ce6e8379845bdb6ad73e3d0f979b379f","amp;dn":"Snooky+Pryor+-+%5B1994%5D+In+This+Mess+Up+To+My+Chest+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24bf3ac5ce6e8379845bdb6ad73e3d0f979b379f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,191,58,197,206,110,131,121,132,91,219,106,215,62,61,15,151,155,55,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
