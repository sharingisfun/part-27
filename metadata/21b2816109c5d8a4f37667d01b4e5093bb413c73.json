This ship has been attacked and the plutonium stolen, posing a grave threat. Suspecting that heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been set up, Tony dons the Iron Man armor and vows to retrieve the plutonium and clear his name. He tracks down the stolen nuclear material and discovers that Zodiac, a terrorist group associated with Advanced Idea Mechanics (A.I.M.), is behind the theft. Reporter Nanami Ota gets caught up in the chase and nearly killed, attempting to get TonyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s attention. Iron Man ultimately defeats the Zodiac warrior, Cancer, and retrieves the plutonium while Nanami finally gets to write her first story on Tony Stark..\n\nGenre: Action | Sci-fi | Animation\nRelease date: August 6th, 2011\n\n:\n\nGeneral:\n\nFormat: x264\nFile Size: 790 MiB\nOverall Bit Rate: 4 691 Kbps\nDuration: 23mn 32s\nSample:: No\nSubtitles: No\n\n\n\n\nContainer: mkv(.mkv)\nVideo Codec Type: H.264/AVC\nVideo bitrate: ~ 4600 Kbps\nResolution: 1280 x 720\nDisplay aspect ratio: 16:9\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nSource:\nMarvel Japan -Thanks!!\n\n\n\n\nAudio 1\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AC3\nBitrate Mode: CBR\nBitrate: 384 Kbps\nSample Rate: 48.0 kHz\nChannel(s): 6 channels (Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE)\nAudio 2\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate Mode: CBR\nBitrate: 160 Kbps\nSample Rate: 48.0 kHz\nChannel(s): 2 channels (Front: L , R)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21b2816109c5d8a4f37667d01b4e5093bb413c73","amp;dn":"Iron+Man+Anime+S01E02+Chase+the+Missing+Nuke+720p+WEB-DL+DD5.1+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21b2816109c5d8a4f37667d01b4e5093bb413c73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,178,129,97,9,197,216,164,243,118,103,208,27,78,80,147,187,65,60,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
