He has grown up on the frontier of a British colony, America. Far from any town, or news of the war against the King that American patriots have begun near Boston.\n\nBut the war comes to them. British soldiers and Iroquois attack. SamuelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s parents are taken away, prisoners. Samuel follows, hiding, moving silently, determined to find a way to rescue them. \n\nEach day he confronts the enemy, and the tragedy and horror of this war. But he also discovers allies, men and women working secretly for the patriot cause. And he learns that he must go deep into enemy territory to find his parents: all the way to the British headquarters, New York City.\n\nGenre: Fiction/Historical/Young Adult","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd45d8650e78e7754f3e26b9b8e6f77b4e934916","amp;dn":"Woods+Runner+by+Gary+Paulsen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd45d8650e78e7754f3e26b9b8e6f77b4e934916","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,69,216,101,14,120,231,117,79,62,38,185,184,230,247,123,78,147,73,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
