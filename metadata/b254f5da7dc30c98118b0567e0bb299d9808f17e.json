A diminutive locomotive with a short wheelbase (1.83m), the 02 was designed especially for use in yards with a restricted loading gauge or with tight track curvatures. It was fitted with a Rolls Royce 6-cylinder diesel engine producing 170 horsepower, and its low gearing gave it a top speed of 19 miles per hour.\n\nOnly 20 examples were built, and the type had only a relatively short service life with the last being withdrawn from service in the mid-1970s. However, many 02s were purchased by private companies and continued working for their new owners for many years, and 7 remain in preservation today","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b254f5da7dc30c98118b0567e0bb299d9808f17e","amp;dn":"RailWorks+-+Class+02+Shunter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b254f5da7dc30c98118b0567e0bb299d9808f17e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,84,245,218,125,195,12,152,17,139,5,103,224,187,41,157,152,8,241,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
