Together they conceived and wrote a series of ten novels about the exploits of detectives from the special homicide commission of the national police in which the character of Martin Beck was the main protagonist. Both authors also wrote novels separately. For the Martin Beck series, they plotted and researched each book together. They were ranked no.15 of top crime writers of all time.\n\n\n\n\n1.Roseanna The discovery of the body of an unknown woman who was raped sends Detective Inspector Beck of the Stockholm Homicide Squad on a six-month search to determine the identity of the victim and her killer.\n\n2.The Man Who Went Up in Smoke Stockholm Homicide Squad's Inspector Martin Beck is assigned to search for a vanished Swedish journalist and finds himself becoming involved in an international racket. \n\n3.The Man on the Balcony Swedish police superintendent Martin Beck conducts a thorough investigation of a series of brutal muggings and child sex murders.\n\n4.The Laughing Policeman (Investigation of Murder) On a cold and rainy Stockholm night, nine bus riders are gunned down by an unknown assassin. The press, anxious for an explanation for the seemingly random crime, quickly dubs him a madman. But Superintendent Martin Beck of the Stockholm Homicide Squad suspects otherwise. This apparently motiveless killer has managed to target one of Beck s best detectives and he, surely, would not have been riding that lethal bus without a reason.\n\n5.The Fire Engine That Disappeared The cunning incendiary device that blew the roof off a Stockholm apartment not only interrupted the small, peaceful orgy underway inside, it nearly took the lives of the building's eleven occupants. And if one of Martin Beck's colleagues hadn't been on the scene, the explosion would have led to a major catastrophe since-for reasons nobody could satisfactorily explain-a regulation firetruck has vanished. Was it terrorism, suicide, or simply a gas leak? And what, if anything, did the explosion have to do with the peculiar death earlier that day of a forty-six-year-old bachelor whose cryptic suicide note consisted of only two words: 'Martin Beck' ?\n\n6.Murder at the Savoy When a powerful industrialist is casually shot during an after-dinner speech, the repercussions are widespread. As Martin Beck investigates, he discovers that he has nothing but contempt for the victim and sympathy for the murderer!\n\n7.The Abominable Man The striking seventh novel in the Martin Beck mystery series by Maj SjÃƒÂ¶wall and Per WahlÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂ¶, finds Beck facing one of the greatest challenges in his professional career.\n\nThe gruesome murder of a police captain in his hospital room reveals the unsavory history of a man who spent forty years practicing a horrible blend of strong-arm police work and shear brutality. Martin Beck and his colleagues feverishly comb Stockholm for the murderer, a demented and deadly rifleman, who has plans for even more chaos. As the tension builds and a feeling of imminent danger grips Beck, his investigation unearths evidence of police corruption. That's when an even stronger sense of responsibility and something like shame urge him into taking a series of drastic steps, which lead to a shocking disaster.\n\n8.The Locked Room The mysterious shooting of a man found dead in a locked room sends Martin Beck searching for clues through Sweden.\n\n9.Cop Killer The shocking ninth novel in the Martin Beck mystery series by Maj SjÃƒÂ¶wall and Per WahlÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂ¶ finds Beck investigating parallel cases that have shocked a small rural community.\n\nIn a country town, a woman is brutally murdered and left buried in a swamp. There are two main suspects: her closest neighbor and her ex-husband. Meanwhile, on a quiet suburban street a midnight shootout takes place between three cops and two teenage boys. Dead, one cop and one kid. Wounded, two cops. Escaped, one kid. Martin Beck and his partner Lenart Kollberg are called in to investigate. As Beck digs deeper into the murky waters of the young girl's murder, Kollberg scours the town for the teenager, and together they are forced to examine the changing face of crime. \n\n10.The Terrorists The last Martin Beck mystery, tragically finished just a few weeks before Per Wahloo's death. \nThe main plot of The Terrorists involves Martin Beck leading a team of policemen to prevent a presumed terrorist attack on a highly unpopular American senator who is paying an official visit to Sweden. However, this is the time of the Vietnam war, and Sweden is full of anti-American demonstrations because of the American involvement in Vietnam. Anti-American sentiments are strong. How can the senator best be protected? \nWhile Gunvald Larsson is sent to Latin-America to learn about protection, a politician is killed right in front of him. There are signals that the same terrorists are also planning to attack the American guest in Sweden. \nThe book is, in effect, a marvelous summing up.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b5969637bb2845d4cc41a1f5d47905c67f85ea7","amp;dn":"Martin+Beck+Series+by+Maj+Sj%26ouml%3Bwall+%26amp%3B+Per+Wahl%26ouml%3B%26ouml","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b5969637bb2845d4cc41a1f5d47905c67f85ea7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,89,105,99,123,178,132,93,76,196,26,31,93,71,144,92,103,248,94,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
