Right after they make a sandwich. Or play\nsome video games. Wait, there's laundry to do. (&quot;Not it!&quot;) After that, they'll\ndefinitely go fight some crime. Maybe... Inspired by the original hit series\nTeen Titans from Warner Bros. Animation, TEEN TITANS GO! features the return of\nRobin, Starfire, Raven, Beast Boy and Cyborg in all-new comedic adventures. These\nfive super hero teens have more than just super powers - they have super-sized\nchores to do and they're super unsupervised! Saving the world might seem like a\npretty big deal, but after fighting evil all day in Jump City, the last thing\nthese teens want to do is fight over the remote back home at Titans Tower or have\nto clean up after a marathon pizza party. So get ready for comedic mayhem punctuated\nby pranks as the teens totally annoy each other, with a splash of crime fighting.\nUnless there's something good on TV...\n\nProduced by DC Comics, Cartoon Network and Warner Bros. Animation.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img138/9568/3y7c.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img138/9568/3y7c.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCyborg creates a huge Titan robot powered by all five Titans, each of\nwhom controls a different body part. Even though Cyborg tells Robin\nthat everybody's part is as good as the others, Robin gripes about his\nrole as the left leg and makes some improvements to his section of the\nrobot to make sure that the left leg is the most powerful part of all.\n\nTeen.Titans.Go.S01E13b.The.Left.Leg.WEB-DL.x264.AAC.mp4\n\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 720x404 23.976fps [CRF 20.0]\nAudio: MPEG4 Audio (AAC) 48000Hz stereo  [128Kbps ABR]\nSubs: English Closed Captions (SubRip Text)\nDuration: 00:11:11\nFile size: 69 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10aea43eba95770dfadd160fb58e097259d7ffc7","amp;dn":"Teen.Titans.Go.S01E13b.The.Left.Leg.WEB-DL.x264.AAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10aea43eba95770dfadd160fb58e097259d7ffc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,174,164,62,186,149,119,13,250,221,22,15,181,142,9,114,89,215,255,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
