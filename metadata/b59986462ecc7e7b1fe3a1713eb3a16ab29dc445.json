From start to finish, the songs flow from one to another in an effortless manner that speaks volumes to the maturity of this band. Having had the opportunity to see them live, I can confirm that the record captures the energy and intimacy of their live shows magnificently. It goes beyond that, however. The clean, organized mixes show off intricacies in their arrangements that are often lost in the hubbub of a live show. The vibe of the album reminds me a little bit of the first Paper Kites EP Ã¢â‚¬â€œ warm, clean, and oddly familiar in a very pleasant way. It creates a feeling for which thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no real adequate term for in English Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in German it would be Ã¢â‚¬Å“sehnsucht.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ C.S. Lewis describes it as Ã¢â‚¬Å“that unnameable something, desire for which pierces us like a rapier at the smell of bonfire, the sound of wild ducks flying overhead, the title of The Well at the WorldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s End, the opening lines of Ã¢â‚¬ËœKubla KhanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, the morning cobwebs in late summer, or the noise of falling waves.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Simply put, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a nostalgia for a home youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never had, or a place youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never been. The ability of this album to inspire that feeling in a listener is remarkable, and it clearly demonstrates their ability to communicate effectively through music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b59986462ecc7e7b1fe3a1713eb3a16ab29dc445","amp;dn":"Deadwood+Floats+-+Three+Years+%282014%29+%5BMP3+320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b59986462ecc7e7b1fe3a1713eb3a16ab29dc445","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,153,134,70,46,204,126,123,31,227,161,113,62,179,161,106,178,157,196,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
