Tanenbaum ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ with colleague Martin van Steen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ presents a complete introduction that identifies the seven key principles of distributed systems, with extensive examples of each.  \n\nAdds a completely new chapter on architecture to address the principle of organizing distributed systems. \nProvides extensive new material on peer-to-peer systems, grid computing and Web services, virtualization, and application-level multicasting. \n\nUpdates material on clock synchronization, data-centric consistency, object-based distributed systems, and file systems and Web systems coordination.  \n\nFor all developers, software engineers, and architects who need an in-depth understanding of distributed systems.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edec21ac2f19c859678bc8cdbc38426c36507420","amp;dn":"Distributed+Systems+-+Principles+and+Paradigms+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edec21ac2f19c859678bc8cdbc38426c36507420","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,236,33,172,47,25,200,89,103,139,200,205,188,56,66,108,54,80,116,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
