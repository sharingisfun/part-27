Just months after this single was released, vocalist Blaze Bayley would part ways with Iron Maiden. The song was voted as one of the most popular Iron Maiden songs of all time in a fan poll taken during the making of the Ed Hunter album and video game. It is one of two Blaze Bayley era songs to make it onto the Edward the Great compilation, along with &quot;Man on the Edge&quot;. The cover of the single is also notable for depicting band mascot Eddie, in CG form, as the cyborg form he had on Somewhere in Time.\n\nIron Maiden frequently played this song during the Ed Hunter tour in 1999, making it one of five Bayley era songs to survive in concerts after his departure.\n\nA 1999 live recording of this song appears on the band's next single release, &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;.\n\nDuring live performances on the Ed Hunter tour a giant robot Eddie appeared from backstage and &quot;battled&quot; members of the band.\n\nThe guitar solo in &quot;Futureal&quot; is played by Dave Murray.\n\nThe single came with a poster by Derek Riggs that for some reason didn't make the cover.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Futureal&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (Blaze Bayley, Steve Harris) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:00\n    &quot;The Evil That Men Do live - 4:20\n    &quot;Man on the Edge live - 4:09","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b43406bea237af3602a0ec2de3c0b966cda5b784","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+Futureal+%5BSingle%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b43406bea237af3602a0ec2de3c0b966cda5b784","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,52,6,190,162,55,175,54,2,160,236,45,227,192,185,102,205,165,183,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
