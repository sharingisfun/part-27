KG\n========================================================================\n\nH2testw was developed to test USB sticks for various kinds of errors.\nIt can also be used for any other storage media like memory cards,\ninternal and external hard drives and even network volumes.\n\nThe executable file H2testw.exe needs no installation and can be\ndirectly run. It was developed for Windows XP and Vista. It should\nalso work under Windows 2000 but was only tested on XP and Vista.\nWindows 9x/ME is not supported. You can use the older command line\nprogram H2test under these operating systems.\n\nThe function of H2testw is quite simple: It fills the chosen target\ndirectory with test data and then reads it back and verifies it.\n\nH2testw does not overwrite or erase any existing data. It doesn&amp;#039;t\ndo any low-level tricks so administrator privileges are not required.\nIf your hardware is working properly H2testw will not harm any\nexisting data.\n\nBUT: _If_ the hardware is defective then H2testw is designed to find\nthat defect and might as a side effect damage existing files.\nTherefore: IF YOU SUSPECT A USB STICK OR OTHER STORAGE MEDIA TO BE\nDEFECTIVE, EMPTY IT AND TEST IT COMPLETELY WITH H2TESTW. Only empty\nmedia can be fully tested with H2testw. In order to be able to\nreproduce the results we recommend to format the media (quick format\nwill do) and then test it.\n\nH2testw writes files of up to 1 GByte to the chosen destination and\nnames them 1.h2w, 2.h2w, 3.h2w and so on. If the target directory\nalread contains such a set of files H2testw will offer to verify them.\nIf there are any other files named *.h2w it will refuse to work. In\nthat case please erase all files *.h2w and hit the Refresh button.\n\nAfter it is done the software leaves its test files on the medium.\nYou can erase them if you like or verify them again -- if it&amp;#039;s a USB\nstick for instance with another PC.\n\nThe check box &quot;endless verify&quot; does just that: It puts the verify\nroutine in an endless loop that stops only if an error is found. This\nis meant to be used as a long-time test to find sporadic data transfer\nerrors.\n\nA remark on the estimated time remaining: For intact flash memory the\nestimate should be pretty exact since it has a constant data rate.\nWith defective media we have seen massive drops in the transfer rate\nresulting in the estimate increasing instead of decreasing. Hard\ndrives are slower on the inner tracks than on the outer tracks so when\ntesting a hard drive the estimate is never precise.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions for H2testw please send an\nemail to Harald BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶geholz &lt;&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;422a3520022a272b31276c2627&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;&gt; (in German or English).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b352c89ede8ffcd8bedf22490763563d1914e593","amp;dn":"utility+to+test+flash+drives+for+errors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b352c89ede8ffcd8bedf22490763563d1914e593","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,82,200,158,222,143,252,216,190,223,34,73,7,99,86,61,25,20,229,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
