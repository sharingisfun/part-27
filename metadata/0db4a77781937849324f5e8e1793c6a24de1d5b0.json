They all have covers, and most of them are formatted correctly. One or two might be a bit quirky, but definately readable.\n\nI put this up, because I found it hard to get a selection of books that I could just put onto my Ipad without worrying about covers and formatting.\n\nBooks Include:\n\nPride and Prejudice Jane Austen \nThe Long Walk Stephen King \nThe Running Man Stephen King \nThinner Stephen King \nThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz Lyman Frank Baum \nThe Bourne Supremacy \nFrancis Scott Fitzgerald - The Great Gatsby.ÃƒÂ¢","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0db4a77781937849324f5e8e1793c6a24de1d5b0","amp;dn":"Misc+Epubs+for+iPad","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0db4a77781937849324f5e8e1793c6a24de1d5b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,180,167,119,129,147,120,73,50,79,94,142,23,147,198,162,77,225,213,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
