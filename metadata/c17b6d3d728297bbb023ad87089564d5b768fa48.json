Despite heavy promotion, the show was unsuccessful and was canceled after one season. Transmission and production were also delayed by the real-life on-stage mauling of Roy Horn.\n\nThe show features the voice talent of John Goodman, Danielle Harris, Cheryl Hines, Carl Reiner, Orlando Jones, Julian Holloway, Daryl Sabara and David Herman. The per-episode cost of the series was reportedly US$1.6 million and each episode took nine months to create. Due to costs, physical animation production was contracted to the Hong Kong-based Imagi Animation Studios.\n\nThe show was almost cancelled long before its broadcast, following the near-death of Roy Horn in October 2003; but after his condition improved, both Siegfried and Roy urged NBC to continue production. The show was promoted heavily during NBC's coverage of the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece and garnered above average ratings for the network, but the show received a negative response from TV critics who considered it to be little more than a gimmick and a shill for other NBC and DreamWorks properties (two early episodes extensively featured The Today Show's Matt Lauer and another featured Donkey - voiced by Eddie Murphy - from the DreamWorks movie Shrek and Shrek 2). Also many TV critics noticed that the show's humor was very similar to South Park (one episode had a character say &quot;Screw you guys, I'm going home&quot;).\n\nThe show's ratings began to decline, and by November 2004 it was pulled from NBC's sweeps line-up. In early December 2004, the CEO of DreamWorks announced that the show was canceled, a few months after it was initially aired. A DVD version of the show has been made available, containing the original pilot, an alternate pilot (which draws heavily on the original), an un-aired episode, and one episode that was voice-recorded, but was not animated, and therefore remains at the storyboard stage.\n\n\n\nCharacter\tVoice actor\nLarry\t        John Goodman\nKate\t        Cheryl Hines\nSarmoti\t        Carl Reiner\nSnack\t        Orlando Jones\nSierra\t        Danielle Harris\nHunter\t        Daryl Sabara\nRoy\t        David Herman\nSiegfried\tJulian Holloway\n\nGuest Stars\n\n\nFoo-Lin\t        Lisa Kudrow\nDonkey\t        Eddie Murphy\nEmerson      \tDanny DeVito\nBlake      \tJohn O'Hurley\nVictoria\tWendie Malick\nNelson      \tAndy Richter\nBernie      \tGarry Marshall\nTommy      \tDavid Spade\nKelsey Grammer\tKelsey Grammer\nRoger\t        Greg Cipes\nHi Larious\tSeth McFarlane\nVincent      \tDon Stark\nSnout Brothers\tJohn DiMaggio\nLily\t        Amanda Peet\nTom      \tJohn DiMaggio\nDuke      \tDom DeLuise\nChaz      \tDenis Leary\nEdna Falvey\tKathryn Joosten\nBrittany\tJulia Sweeney\nChutney      \tBrian George\nJustin      \tPauly Shore\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c17b6d3d728297bbb023ad87089564d5b768fa48","amp;dn":"Father+of+the+Pride+%282004+Animated+TV+Comedy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c17b6d3d728297bbb023ad87089564d5b768fa48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,123,109,61,114,130,151,187,176,35,173,135,8,149,100,213,183,104,250,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
