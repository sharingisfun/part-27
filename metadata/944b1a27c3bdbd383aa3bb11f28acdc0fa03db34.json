Issues raised include: should you raise your child with the same rules you raise your pets;\n should women be in combat.\n\n\nPrager 20130201  2 Happiness Hour: Everybody Has Pain\n\nPrager H2: Dennis returns to one of his foundational happiness themes. Forty-five minutes after the hour a man \n thanks Dennis for stopping him from taking his life. It happened years ago. And now, near the end of his life,\n he wants to acknowledge the debt.\n\n\nPrager 20130201  1 Hagel Hearings\n\nPrager H1: The media admits that Defense Department nominee Chuck Hagel didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a good day yesterday \n at his Senate Confirmation hearings. But was it a ''bad day'' or is Hagel is poorly qualified for the job?\n Or, to put it another way, why did the President nominate him? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         Download, seed, and spread the word.
