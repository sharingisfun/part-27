I live in a country in which a good/original record's cost is about equal with the cost of living for a week (or more), so my only source was(God bless the peeps there!) So don't get smart-ass on me with copyrights and whatnots. I really didn't have any other choice. I would love to have enough money to support the great artists out there, but hey, it is what it is.\n\nAs our brave president told Bill Gates on his visit to Romania: &quot;The piracy helped Romania in the '90s to get ahead with the technology and was actually a good thing&quot;! (Well, to say that as a president to the man whose programs were the first target of software pirats... well that's another story.)\n\nSo last year I got to hear Asylum and got really hooked ever since. Hooked like, you know, not really listening anything else on my MP3 player! The sound of Dinka fits me perfectly: wheather I am happy or sad, uplifting or mellow, anytime is a great time for me to listen to Dinka.\n\nThe problem I faced was that you hardly find anything on torrents, much less on the web. With the exception ofSo I set up to extract every single video onand convert it to mp3, which at start it really was all there was. I'm not sure what kind of encoding usesI don't really know (and care to find) what is the bitrate of the &quot;normal&quot; videos in contrast with the &quot;HQ&quot; ones. So I encoded all the mp3s at 192 kbit -- it's a pretty good bitrate and I don't think the videos onhad a greater bitrate, most likely a smaller one. And if you don't like the encoding, go buy the CDs! (Now I'm being smart-ass myself)\n\nSo without further dues, here it is, the great, the amazing sound of Dinka, for your listening pleasure! SEVEN HOURS (!) of this music should be enough for anyone for a long time.\n\nIn the _Dinka folder you'll find the original mixes and also the remixes other DJs did to Dinka's tunes. In _Dinka Remixes you'll find the remixes they did (I hear there's three swiss guys in the act) for other producers. In _just for fun folder you'll find two interesting mashups I found onI don't like them along with the other tracks, so I just placed them there. Mixing Dinka with D12 may not be your cup of tea, but the result is weird as much as it's funny. So it's worth checking out. I left out of the compilation maybe two tracks, can't remember precisely, they were tribal or deep electro mixes maybe, if i remember well, and i thought they really messed up with the general sound of the collection. Feel free to search them onand add them on your own playlist.\n\nAlso I would gladly accept contributions to this compilation: maybe better encoded tracks, tracks that I didn't know about, new additions, etc. Feel free to contact me for any comments or suggestions. AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED!!! I can't stress this enough. I have a crappy Acer Extensa laptop with only 80GB hard drive which I constantly have fully occupated with other crap (music, pirated apps, hard porn -- usual male stuff, you know). That means I don't have the luxury of seeding a very long time, so please be so kind and contribute to this effort by seeding as long as you can. God will save your soul, women will fall at your feet, the world will be yours to take... ...or maybe not. But at least seeding something you got for free anyway, will always be the GOOD, FAIR and RIGHT thing to do.\n\nI intend in the future to make compilations like this one also for some other favorites DJs of mine: Jaytech, Paul Kelley, Proff... we'll see.\n\n[I suggest you shuffle the playlist in your player, or generate other custom playlists, I know it gets a little boring to hear the tracks only in the alphabetic order.]\n\nYours sincerely,\nCintezica / Bumbacel (I use'em both)\n\nContact me at (you know the drill):\ncintezica-at-gmail-dot-com\nbumbacel_bumbescu-at-yahoo-dot-com\n...or just PM me.\n\n\nWINAMP Generated Playlist:\n\n56 tracks in playlist\nAverage track length: 7:30\nPlaylist length: 7 hours 5 seconds \n\n1.
