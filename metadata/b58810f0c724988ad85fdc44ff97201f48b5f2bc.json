But the first track doesn't disappoint any Atomic Swing fan. &quot;Stuck on a Worn Out Rhyme&quot; kicks off with a typical Frisk guitar riff, and what follows is a typical Atomic Swing pop song, which means one of the album's peaks. Then we enter the soul zone. &quot;So In Need of a Change&quot; is a duet between Frisk and Ronnie Spector, and it's not unfair to think of it as a soul piece. And that is also a suitable label for &quot;Teenage Divina,&quot; &quot;Soul Free&quot; and &quot;Envy Moon.&quot; But there are some really good songs on this album as well. Except for the opening track, &quot;Like a John Needs a Yoko&quot; and &quot;Suburban Wing&quot; are excellent and give a reminder of how they used to sound. This would prove to be the last peak of the group's career.
