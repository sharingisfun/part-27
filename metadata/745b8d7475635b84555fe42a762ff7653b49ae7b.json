If you&amp;#039;re already a fan of this music and \nhave cds by many of the artists contained herein, you&amp;#039;ll probably find some songs \nrepeated from your current collection, but you&amp;#039;ll also find a swath of songs by more \nobscure artists than those mentioned here... \nI certainly hadn&amp;#039;t heard of Keith Loyd, Bill Strength or Andy Schroder. \nThe mastering/recording quality is generally pretty good.\nThanks go to this German record label for offering up this great old American music \nso affordably.\n\nDisk: 15  \n1.
