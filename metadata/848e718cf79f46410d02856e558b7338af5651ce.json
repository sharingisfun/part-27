This is the latest release of the BlackBerry PlayBook OS as of 03/03/2012, so it includes the Android Runtime.\n\nThe image works on Windows, Linux + Mac and is a self-extracting .exe, the actual image is ~600MB. I added in the BlackBerry Dev Tools so you can install applications and so on (there's a guide URL if you need to know how to do it).\n\nWatch the setup to see how to set it up (obviously). Remember to seed!\n\nThe Self-Extractor should have the following hashes: \n\nMD5: 8204659277122d5ed31416c3433b19d1\nSHA1: 12949c5036415584652ab70f2afea61c559cedf5\nCRC32: 4835d2fd\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:848e718cf79f46410d02856e558b7338af5651ce","amp;dn":"BlackBerry+PlayBook+OS+2.0.0+VMware+Image+%2B+Dev+Tools","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"848e718cf79f46410d02856e558b7338af5651ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,142,113,140,247,159,70,65,13,2,133,110,85,139,115,56,175,86,81,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
