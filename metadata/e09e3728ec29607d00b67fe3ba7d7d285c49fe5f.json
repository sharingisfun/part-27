Rock And Roll\r\n2. Sick Again\r\n3. Over The Hills And Far Away\r\n4. In My Time Of Dying\r\n5. The Song Remains The Same\r\n6. The Rain Song\r\n7. Kashmir\r\n\r\nDisc 2\r\n1. No Quarter\r\n2. Trampled Underfoot\r\n3. Moby Dick\r\n\r\nDisc 3 \r\n1. Dazed And Confused\r\n2. Stairway To Heaven\r\n3. Whole Lotta Love\r\n4. Black Dog\r\n\r\nComments: \r\nThis is something like a prelude to the following evening's show. \r\nThe playing is on top form and overall all the songs were performed with \r\nfuriosity. Pagey is in decent form tonight, with especially fine playing \r\non Sick Again, In My Time Of Dying and The Song Remains The Same; Plant is \r\nnot in fine form, though, with his best vocals coming from the songs that \r\ndemanded the least from him, such as No Quarter and Whole Lotta Love; Bonham \r\ndoes bring the bang, with awesome drumming on Over The Hills And Far Away, \r\nKashmir and Trampled Underfoot. Ironically, it is Jones that makes this show \r\nawesome, with amazing bass playing and great keyboards from start to finish. \r\nKashmir was dedicated to &quot;...Richard Cole, our tour manager - a good upright \r\nBritish citizen&quot; and Dazed And Confused to &quot;...our manager, Peter Grant, who's \r\nmade so many things possible. He's the man who gives us the blow job in the \r\ndressing room&quot;. Obviously the whole band had a great time during these two \r\nVancouver shows","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e09e3728ec29607d00b67fe3ba7d7d285c49fe5f","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1975.03.19+Vancouver%2C+Canada+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e09e3728ec29607d00b67fe3ba7d7d285c49fe5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,158,55,40,236,41,96,125,0,182,127,227,186,125,125,40,92,73,254,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
