III 10 years after the events of the first game. The snow has melted to \n\nreveal jungles and more tropical areas that have taken the place of more frozen regions. The plot begins with \n\nMercenaries fighting against Jungle Pirates. After destroying a mine, the Mercenaries continue on to evacuate the \n\narea, in which a Category-G Akrid appears and attacks them. After being rescued, they find out their evacuation \n\npoint (Where the Category-G appeared) was a set-up and no pick up team awaited them.\nThe game then shifts to NEVEC's Black Ops, Task Force First Descent, who fight their way through a Carpetbagger \n\ncity in an effort to capture a railway gun, a train mounted with a massive cannon. After failing to succeed, a \n\n&quot;space Akrid&quot; Appears and begins to attack the group. After it is killed and the members evacuated, it is revealed \n\nthey are clones of Ivan Solotov, a character from Lost Planet: Extreme Condition.\n The story once again shifts, this time to Waysiders, snow pirates living in the desert. They are returning from a \n\nraid on a carpetbagger city, apparently with heavy casualties and not much Thermal Energy.

As they continue towards their home, it starts \n\nsnowing heavily, burying their home. The player 1 waysider notices a giant, glowing orb in the distance and \n\ndeclares &quot;I'm so going to shoot the shit out of you!&quot; and apparently fires at it.\n\n\nMinimum System Requirements :\n=============================\n\n     CPU:\n        - Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo processor or higher\n        - AMD Athlon(TM) X2 Dual-Core Processor or higher\n\n     System RAM:\n        - Windows(R) XP : 1GB or higher\n        - Windows Vista(R) : 2GB or higher\n        - Windows(R) 7 : 2GB or higher\n\n\n     Video Card:\n        DirectX(R)9.0c/Shader3.0 compatible with at least 256MB of video RAM\n        - NVIDIA(R) GeForce(R) 7800 series or higher\n        - ATI Radeon(TM) HD 2400 Pro or higher\n\n     Sound Card:\n        DirectX(R)9.0c compatible sound card\n\n     DVD-ROM Drive:\n        DVD9 compatible Drive\n\n     Monitor:\n       640 x 480ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¼Ã‹â€ SVGAÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¼Ã¢â‚¬Â° or higher\n\n\n\n* enjoy ... *","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a8346e41b35abbbb896100ad0ea945f1586af02","amp;dn":"PC+-+LOST+PLANET+2+MULTI-9+directplay+by+globe%40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a8346e41b35abbbb896100ad0ea945f1586af02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,131,70,228,27,53,171,187,184,150,16,10,208,234,148,95,21,134,175,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
