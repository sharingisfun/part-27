He suffers from memory blackouts where he suddenly finds himself somewhere else, confused. Evan's friends and mother hardly believe him, thinking he makes it up just to get out of trouble. As Evan grows up he has less of these blackouts until he seems to have recovered. Since the age of seven he has written a diary of his blackout moments so he can remember what happens. One day at college he starts to read one of his old diaries, and suddenly a flashback hits him like a brick! \n\n\nAll stand-alone DivX Players compatible\n\n\nU P L O A D E R S  F I N A L  N O T E S\n\nThe director's cut version is originally 120 minutes. For those who wonders, this version is 114 minutes because I had to cut the last .vob containing last part of the credits because it also included 5 minutes of trailers in the end.\nThis is the full movie.\n\nPlease seed!
