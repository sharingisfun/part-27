Fox) and the mad inventor Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) to a graceful, almost leisurely conclusion. Most of the picture takes place in 1885, in the Old West, where the specially rigged DeLorean that has been whipping Marty and Doc back and forth in time runs out of gas. Stalled in a Western, these time travellers from the manic, jumped-up nineteen-eighties adjust their internal clocks and do what characters in Westerns do: they wait. The movie settles into a deliberate and rather soothing rhythm, as if the filmmakers-director Robert Zemeckis and writer Bob Gale-knew there was no point in getting themselves, and us, all het up. The relaxing light-vaudeville mood is a welcome break from the strenuous time-hopping of the first two installments. (It's poky, and it's also a touch boring.) While Zemeckis and Gale are biding their time, setting things up for their frantic grand finale, they keep us amused with an eccentric romance between Doc and a schoolmarm played by Mary Steenburgen. Lloyd and Steenburgen are hilariously well matched-they have perfectly compatible styles of celestial goofiness-and their moonbeam love story is the movie's one true inspiration. Also with Thomas F. Wilson. -Terrence Rafferty\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img81.imageshack.us/img81/308/backtothefuture0wx.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img81.imageshack.us/img81/308/backtothefuture0wx.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n1.
