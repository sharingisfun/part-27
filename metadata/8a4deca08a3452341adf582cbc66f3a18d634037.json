Dressed in bizarre yet stylish costumes, the group offered \na defiantly experimental type of rock.\n\nThey were one of the first bands to create and maintain a carefully crafted \nstyle that encapsulated their stage presentation, videos and record sleeves.\n\nAnd they were a significant influence on new wave music and the experimental \nelectronic groups of the early 1980s.\nBands such as Duran Duran, The Smiths and U2 have all admitted to being \ninfluenced by them.\n \nOver the years, their popularity and reputation have remained strikingly \nconsistent. \nRolling Stone magazine recently ranked Roxy Music in its list of the 100 \nGreatest Artists of All Time.\n\nFerry, the son of a North-East coal miner, wrote most of the songs. \nBut the bands sound was also hugely influenced by co-founder Brian Eno, who \nwent on to become one of the most significant record producers of the late \n20th Century, working with bands such as Talking Heads, U2 and Coldplay.\n\nOther members include saxophonist Andrew Mackay, drummer Paul Thompson and \nguitarist Phil Manzanera.\n__________\n\n 1.
