The result is a rendering tool that offers an incredible suite of features that should satisfy even the most hardcore users without breaking the bank. And the output will stun users in terms of both realism as well as overall control.\nAnimal Logic, Rezn8, Digital Dimension, Encore Hollywood are among the many V-Ray customers that acknowledged the fast, flexible, production-oriented rendering solution from Chaos Group. Packed with a rich set of high-tech cutting-edge features, V-Ray has become the renderer of choice for many broadcast, architectural visualizations SFX companies around the world.\n\n \n**********************************************************************\n\nKey new features\nNew features included:\n- VRayFastSSS2 sub-surface scattering material\n- Linear Workflow\n- Mesh-based lights\n- V-Ray light material as direct light\n- V-Ray Fog environmental effect\n- Vector Displacement\n- Import Proxy as mesh\n- Support for Max Arch &amp; Design materials\n- Region Rendering directly in VFB\n\nMajor features of V-RayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ for 3dsmaxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ ver 1.5 SP4\nThe V-Ray rendering system has a rich set of features; we have listed some of the major ones here.
