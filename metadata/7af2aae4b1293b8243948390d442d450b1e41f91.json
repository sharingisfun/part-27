But what\n        really draws Ned home are memories that have haunted him since\n        adolescence - memories of sexual awakening, forbidden passion,\n        suffocating guilt and a devastating family secret.\n\n        Featuring  an  ensemble  cast of  some  of  Australia's finest\n        actors including Rachel Griffiths, Maeve Dermody and  stunning\n        newcomer  Sophie  Lowe  as  'Kate',  and  brought  to  life in\n        parallel  strands of  past and  present, Beautiful  Kate is  a\n        feast for the senses: bold, evocative and haunting.\n \n \n     \n                                           \n                      CAST                       \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n \n\n                   Rachel Griffiths  ....
