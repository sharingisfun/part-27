Buddy Tate (playing tenor and clarinet in addition to taking a few of Jimmy Rushing-style vocals) is joined by fellow tenor Paul Quinichette (making one of his few recordings of the 1970's), pianist Cliff Smalls (an underrated swing player), bassist Major Holley and drummer Jackie Williams. Other than the opening original &quot;The Texas Twister&quot; and Tate's ballad feature on &quot;Talk Of The Town,&quot; all of the music is from the Basie book including &quot;Chicago,&quot; &quot;Boogie Woogie&quot; and &quot;Topsy.&quot; All of the musicians (most of whom were not making too many recordings in the mid-1970's) sound somewhat inspired and are in fine form.
