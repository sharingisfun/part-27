This volume set out to examine and analyze how governments and military organizations planned for an uncertain and potentially threatening future during four different peacetime periods spanning from the beginning of the 19th century to the aftermath of the Second World War. For each period the authors have explored how the changing nature of military technology and hence of warfare affected military planning and provided a number of cases studies designed to illustrate the challenges and opportunities planners faced within their respective periods. Finally the book discusses what lessons can be drawn from past cases of military planning. \n This book will be of foremost interest to students in military and strategic studies as well as military college staff, policymakers and think tanks personnel.\n\nAmazon.com title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Fog-Peace-War-Planning/dp/0415366976/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374394525&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=the+fog+of+war+and+peace&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Fog-Peace-War-Planning/dp/0415366976/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374394525&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=the+fog+of+war+and+peace&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7efdce1d4ed9889decb9e3a2aec1dbf8d1a39406","amp;dn":"The+Fog+of+Peace+and+War+Planning%3A+Military+and+Strategic+Planni","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7efdce1d4ed9889decb9e3a2aec1dbf8d1a39406","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,253,206,29,78,217,136,157,236,185,227,162,174,193,219,248,209,163,148,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
