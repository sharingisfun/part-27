It plays better than the disjointed due to studiocraft, since the measured, detailed production fleshes out songs held together by a bare minimum of hooks and melodies. Without hooks, 's earnestness is unavoidable. 's emotive, gut-wrenching vocals and the band's hard, heavy delivery are all this record has to offer and the mystery is why the music has such little impact, either as emotional catharsis (which it was intended to be, if the tenor of the performances and 's interviews are to be believed) or as catchy commercial hard rock (which is what the best moments of their first two records were). In an effort to develop their own voice and to be taken seriously, have left behind their natural strengths -- a knack for melodic hooks and riffs. They're undoubtedly sincere and have delivered a professional record, but once is finished it fades away, since it has neither the emotional nor musical substance to make a lasting impact.\nReview by Stephen Thomas Erlewine \nRating 3/5\n\nimage\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n1.&quot;Warm Machine&quot; 4:26\n2.&quot;Jesus Online&quot; 3:44\n3.&quot;The Chemicals Between Us&quot; 3:37\n4.&quot;English Fire&quot; 3:31\n5.&quot;Spacetravel&quot; 4:45\n6.&quot;40 Miles from the Sun&quot; 3:39\n7.&quot;Prizefighter&quot; 5:41\n8.&quot;The Disease of the Dancing Cats&quot; 4:01\n9.&quot;Altered States&quot; 4:10\n10.&quot;Dead Meat&quot; 4:16\n11.&quot;Letting the Cables Sleep&quot; 4:36\n12.&quot;Mindchanger&quot; 4:48\n\n\nSummary:\nCountry: UK\nGenre: Post grunge, alternative rock, electronic rock\n\nMedia Report:\nSource : CD\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : ~813-1000 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55d4a705d7c6e89655aea6ff8492cc310357fc1a","amp;dn":"%281999%29+Bush+-+The+Science+of+Things+%28Remastered+2014%29+%5BFLAC%5D+%7B10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55d4a705d7c6e89655aea6ff8492cc310357fc1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,212,167,5,215,198,232,150,85,174,166,255,132,146,204,49,3,87,252,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
