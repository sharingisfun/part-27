ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an astonishing breakthrough for primate researchersÃ¢â‚¬â€the first time anyone has documented a chimpanzee wielding a carefully prepared, preplanned weapon. But it's only the latest in a slew of extraordinary new findings about ape behavior.\n\nThe more researchers learn about the great apesÃ¢â‚¬â€chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutansÃ¢â‚¬â€the more evidence they find of creative intelligence. What, then, is the essential difference between them and us? &quot;Ape Genius,&quot; a NOVA-National Geographic special, explores that provocative question and examines research that is illuminating the ape mind. Bit by bit, investigators are finding an explanation for why the non-human great apes never made the breakthrough into a human-style culture that builds on the achievements of previous generations.&quot;\n\nFile: PBS.Nova.-.S35E13.-.Ape.Genius.mp4 (500MB)\nResolution: 716x480 (native DVD), 16:9 aspect ratio\nAudio: AAC 48kHz 128kb/s stereo\nVideo: H-264 MPEG-4, 29.97fps\nSubtitles: English\nEncoding: Handbrake, RF=25\nOriginally broadcast: 2008-Feb-19\n\nNote: Wikipedia calls this episode S35E07 (all of their episode numbers seem to differ from here.)\n\nThis episode has been posted twice ( http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4347253/NOVA_Ape_Genius_HDTV_XviD_MiRAGETV and http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4038322/Nova.S35E12.Ape.Genius.HR.HDTV.XviD-K4RM4.avi ) but both seem to be dead, so I'm happy to give back for the almost two hundred episodes of this amazing show that I've found here.\n\nPlease seed to 100% or higher so that this torrent doesn't go the way of the others!
