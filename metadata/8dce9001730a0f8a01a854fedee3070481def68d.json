For this &quot;remaster&quot;, if you will, I did not aim for preserving the authentic original sound, so purists might be disappointed. Instead I tried to get as full sounding a result as I could. Also the 80s recording needed alot of careful work to make sure the result is bright enough, but does not quickly cause ear fatigue due to some of the cymbals and drum elements being very harsh and loud.\nI spent alot of time playing around with this, and used alot of tricks and things to achieve the result I wanted. Some may be happy to know there are no compressors used at all, and the final volume is very reserved, which was necessary due to some quite loud vocal shouts at times.\nOverall the sound is smoother and more &quot;modern&quot; in sound, and besides the volume difference hopefully it should not be as jarring going from this album to their more recent releases as far as the sound is concerned. The result, without having access to the multitrack source files, is the best compromise between thicker guitars, smoother drums, heavier bass and natural-sounding vocals I found possible. The result should hopefully also be playable at higher volumes without anything jumping out and annoying your ears too much.\n\n\n\nI hope this might be of benefit to someone, and do give me your comments and criticism if you want.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dce9001730a0f8a01a854fedee3070481def68d","amp;dn":"Testament+-+The+Legacy+1987+%28Fan+Remaster%29+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dce9001730a0f8a01a854fedee3070481def68d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,206,144,1,115,10,15,138,1,168,84,254,222,227,7,4,129,222,246,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
