The Republic of Strings, Crooked Still, and the Mammals are among those string bands that in recent years have paired virtuosity with youthful energy, playing both old and new tunes on a variety of instrumental groupings.\n\nTaarka fits the bill.\n\nSeed Gathering for a Wintergarden is the fourth album from this Colorado-based quartet: Enion Pelta-Tiller (five-string violin, vocals), Daniel Plane (cello, vocals), David Tiller (mandolin, tenor guitar, vocals), and Troy Robey (bass, vocals).\n\nThe material ranges from Pelta-Tiller s intense chamber-folk instrumental A Whole New You to a cover of Celtic fiddler Liz Carroll s Lost in the Loop.\n\nThere are Gypsy-jazz, bluegrass, Celtic, chamber-folk, jazz, rock, and even Indian influences, all distilled through a gifted group that has toured extensively on the jam-band circuit, but who at its best sounds unlike anyone else in that genre. Taarka s music is unadulterated by commerciality, unpolished by some standards, but always engaging and even provocative. Case in point: listen to the richly textured chamber-jazz string arrangement, burning rock guitar, and Pelta-Tiller s aching vocal on Vestal Flame, which takes its title and lyrics from Josephine Preston Peabody s remarkable poem about a spiritual seeker burned by life's travails.\n\nIt's one of the year s best songs, comparable to Arcade Fire s best work.\n\nViolinist Pelta-Tiller, who wrote or co-wrote five of the 11 tunes on the album, is a classically trained violinist and violist. She attended the Peabody Institute and worked toward a viola performance degree before hopping onboard this musical caravan.\n\nCellist Plane studied classical music at the Interlochen Academy and later attended the Berklee College of Music, where he studied with Eugene Friesen and Rushad Eggleston. Bassist Robey has played electric bass and studied double bass. He competed in 2007 and 2008 in the international Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival in Moscow, Idaho, and won the collegiate-level bass soloist award both years. Together with mandolinist and guitarist Tiller who honed his chops studying classical and jazz guitar as well as bluegrass mandolin this eclectic quartet has harvested a bountiful feast of new string-band music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf3e77c94b2ca29da81f373a90075cd9bd6769eb","amp;dn":"Taarka+-+Seed+Gathering+for+a+Winter+Garden+%5B2009%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf3e77c94b2ca29da81f373a90075cd9bd6769eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,62,119,201,75,44,162,157,168,31,55,58,144,7,92,217,189,103,105,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
