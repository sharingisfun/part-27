It's not a song, pause, next song...the songs flow right from one into another. Every emotion that you feel around the holidays is on this CD. His duet, &quot;Baby It's Cold Outside,&quot; is the best I've heard since Dean Martin's version. You're right there in his New York apartment with a blizzard going on outside. And, of course, the final song is his famous, &quot;It's Just Another New Year's Eve,&quot; which I think has saved many a person's sanity over the holidays. I know a previous reviewer lamented the fact that this CD should not be sold in supermarkets or on bargain racks...but you know, maybe other people like us will discover and share the excellence of this Christmas music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9cf85957c008a66ce0f0852c0c29d639aa9766e","amp;dn":"Barry+Manilow+-+Because+It%27s+Christmas+320cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9cf85957c008a66ce0f0852c0c29d639aa9766e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,207,133,149,124,0,138,102,206,15,8,82,192,194,157,99,154,169,118,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
