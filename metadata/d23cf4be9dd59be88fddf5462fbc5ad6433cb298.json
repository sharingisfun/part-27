Weigley, AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foremost military historian, For the Common Defense is an essential contribution to the field of military history. This carefully researched third edition provides the most complete and current history of United States defense policy and military institutions and the conduct of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wars. Without diminishing the value of its earlier editions, authors Allan R. Millett, Peter Maslowski, and William B. Feis provide a fresh perspective on the continuing issues that characterize national security policy. They have updated the work with new material covering nearly twenty years of scholarship, including the history of the American military experience in the Balkans and Somalia, analyzing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan from 2001 to 2012, and providing two new chapters on the Vietnam War.\n\nFor the Common Defense examines the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pluralistic military institutions in both peace and war, the tangled civil-military relations that created the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s commitment to civilian control of the military, the armed forcesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ increasing nationalization and professionalization, and AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s growing reliance on sophisticated technologies spawned by the Industrial Revolution and the Computer and Information Ages. This edition is also a timely reminder that vigilance is indeed the price of liberty but that vigilance has always beenÃ¢â‚¬â€and continues to beÃ¢â‚¬â€a costly, complex, and contentious undertaking in a world that continually tests AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s willingness and ability to provide for the common defense.\n\n\nBy Allan R.
