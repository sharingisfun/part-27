The songs span from the 1920s until the 70s. \n\nAl Jolson opens the album with his career defining song Mammy; the song was his trademark, and he himself the most popular Broadway star and film actor at one point. Next on the bill is Rudolph Valentino, singing Kahmiri Love Song, the only audio recorded legacy of this classic silent film star. As the songs fly by, we hear blonde bombshell Jean Harlow rasping out Reckless, Fred Astaire classically singing Chee to Cheek, Marlene Dietrich with Lola, ad Judy Garland giving her famous rendition of Over the Rainbow. Mae West, Gloria Swanson, Joan Crawford, and Rita Hayworth do some numbers too! The males hold their own, with stars like Jimmy Stewart and Clark Gable, Gene Kelly and Jimmy Cagney. Bob Hope and Bing Crosby sing the hilarious theme song from Road to Morocco and Dorothy Lamour sings a beautiful solo piece entitled Lovely Hula Hands.\nThe second C.D. is the latter half of film music, including Marilyn Monroe breathlessly singing Diamonds are a Girl&amp;#039;s Best Friend, Crosby&amp;#039;s White Christmas, Ann Miller singing Too Darn Hot,and Maurice Chevalier with Thank Heaven for Little Girls. Superstar Bette Davis does They&amp;#039;re Either Too Young or to Old. Louis Armstrong performs Hello Dolly! Gloria De Haven sings a beautiful rendition of Who&amp;#039;s Sorry Now and Noel Coward entertains with a hilarious version of Let&amp;#039;s Do It. Cary Grant, Jack Nicholson, Robert Mitchum, Tyronne Power, and even Marlon Brando do their numbers.\nThis album is truly a must have. It&amp;#039;s not the songs that make it, and it&amp;#039;s not the films their from...what this album does is represent brilliantly the cinema superstars of the century.
