Welcome to our weekly countdown of the 40 best-selling songs in the USA.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nElvis is at number 40 with his 127th hit single.\n\nThere is a hit by an ex-convict whose trouble with the law kept him out of the draft, and gave him a hit record album which was made into a major motion picture, in which he starred.\n\nMany stations refused to play &quot;My Ding-A-Ling&quot; by Chuck Berry (this week at number 31) even when it reached number one. Casey's introduction of the song sounds as if he is justifying his decision to play it.\n\nThe highest debuting record in the countdown is the title song in a motion picture starring 4,000 rats.\n\nRick Springfield (Jessie's Girl) is at number 29 with his first hit, &quot;Speak To The Sky&quot; way before he ever got called Bruce.\nOne song on the chart is by an act that got booked for a guest appearance with the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra. Orchestra members protested by refusing to wear tuxedos stuffing tissue in their ears. By the end of the show, the orchestra gave this act a standing ovation.\n\n40: Burning Love - Elvis Presley\n39: Sealed With A Kiss - Bobby Vinton\n38: This World - The Staple Singers\n37: Get On The Good Foot (Part 1) - James Brown\n36: The City Of New Orleans - Arlo Guthrie\n35: Baby Let Me Take You (In My Arms) - Detroit Emeralds\n34: The Happiest Girl In The Whole U.S.A. - Donna Fargo\n33: Use Me - Bill Withers\n32: Coconut - Nilsson\n31: My Ding-A-Ling - Chuck Berry\n30: YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Still A Young Man - Tower Of Power\n29: Speak To The Sky - Rick Springfield\n28: Nights In White Satin - The Moody Blues\n27: Looking Through The Windows - The Jackson 5\n26: Ben - Michael Jackson\n25: Pop That Thang - The Isley Brothers\n24: (If Loving You Is Wrong) I DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Want To Be Right - Luther Ingram\n23: Popcorn - Hot Butter\n22: Everybody Plays The Fool - The Main Ingredient\n21: Play Me - Neil Diamond\n20: Run To Me - Bee Gees\n19: Motorcycle Mama - Sailcat\n18: Power Of Love - Joe Simon\n17: Join Together - The Who\n16: Beautiful Sunday - Daniel Boone\n15: Go All The Way - The Raspberries\n14: Goodbye To Love - Carpenters\n13: Honky Cat - Elton John\n12: Hold Your Head Up - Argent\n11: Guitar Man - Bread\n10: Saturday In The Park - Chicago\n9: Black And White - Three Dog Night\n8: You Don't Mess Around With Jim - Jim Croce\n7: Rock &amp; Roll Part 2 - Gary Glitter\n6: Backstabbers - The OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Jays\n5: Brandy (YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re A Fine Girl) - Looking Glass\n4: Baby DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Get Hooked On Me - Mac Davis\n3: IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Still In Love With You - Al Green\n2: Long Cool Woman In A Black Dress - Hollies\n1: Alone Again (Naturally) - Gilbert OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Sullivan\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c3a384afd983ddc1d7aca1785111e6bb8200180","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1972_September_9th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c3a384afd983ddc1d7aca1785111e6bb8200180","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,58,56,74,253,152,61,220,29,122,202,23,133,17,30,107,184,32,1,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
