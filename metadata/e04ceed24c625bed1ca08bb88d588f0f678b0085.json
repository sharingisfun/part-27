This is both misleading and ridiculous. While &quot;Duck Soup&quot; now receives the most critical acclaim, one need only compare that film to Room Serivce to see a dramatic improvement in the directing and delivery. Room Service wasn&amp;#039;t written explicitly for the Marx Brothers, so it doesn&amp;#039;t have catchy lines. Still, the film flows much better than predecessors and is still pretty damn funny. The Marx Brothers made many great movies, and yes, this is one of those great ones! \nAt the Circus (1939)\nadvertisement  photos   board   trailer   details  \n\nRegister or login to rate this title User Rating: 6.8/10 (1,594 votes) \nmore Photos (see all 17 | slideshow)  \n           \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverview\nDirector:Edward Buzzell\n\nWriter:Irving Brecher (writer)\n\nRelease Date:20 October 1939 (USA) more \nGenre:Comedy | Family | Musical more \nTagline:NOT SUITABLE FOR GENERAL EXHIBITION (Australian one-sheet poster) more \nPlot:Jeff Wilson, the owner of a small circus, owes his partner Carter $10000.

It has a lot of slapstick, but far from the anarchic quality of before. This film dwindles with a few shreds of wit and the odd spark of original comic turn from Harpo. It does not compare well to any of the films that came before but is still superior to films which followed. Nothing new is added to the mix and what remains are a collection of tired routines. The piano solo for Chico and harp solo for Harpo are less engaging and the usual high point of their films; the Chico/ Groucho, Groucho/ Dummont dialogues are just as weary. There is a wonderfully sustained moment of comic lunacy towards the end which includes an orchastra playing on a band stand that is drifting off to sea. An overall unbalanced picture that will satisfy Marxist fans and be regarded as top of the range light entertainment by others. It only suffers because it follows so many comic masterpieces from the Marx Brothers. \nGo West (1940)\nadvertisement  photos   board   trailer   details  \n\nRegister or login to rate this title User Rating: 6.7/10 (1,461 votes) \nmore Photos (see all 6 | slideshow)  \n      \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverview\nDirector:Edward Buzzell\n\nWriter:Irving Brecher (original screenplay)\nmore \nRelease Date:6 December 1940 (USA) more \nGenre:Comedy | Musical | Western more \nTagline:JUMP INTO YOUR BOOTS AND SADDLES...IT&amp;#039;S ROUND-UP TIME IN THE WILD AND WOOLY WEST! more \nPlot:Embezzler, shill, all around confidence man S.

This does feel more like a Marx Bros. film than Go West does, but some stuff doesn&amp;#039;t fit as far as what we have learned about the brothers in all their earlier films. For instance, Chico is funny because he is such a fake Italian, but he is supposed to be real Italian in the Big Store and that just ruins it. Also, it seems that Groucho only half-heartedly goes after Margaret Dumont, and doesn&amp;#039;t really ever insult her as usual. Another difference is that we see Harpo with Groucho before we ever see him with Chico which never happened in any other movie. There were a couple of laugh out loud moments for me (though I can&amp;#039;t remember any right now, even though I watched it an hour ago), but many more downs than ups. I hate, hate, hate the fast motion chase on skates, I forgot I was watching a Marx Brothers film at the end (it seemed more like an episode of the Munsters.) I also found the &quot;Tenement Symphony&quot; with the candle-lighted children to be quite creepy and boring at the same time. I have to say out of their 13 films I place this ahead of Room Service, Love Happy, and Go West so that would put A Night in Casablanca (1946)\nadvertisement  photos   board   trailer   details  \n\nRegister or login to rate this title User Rating: 7.0/10 (1,504 votes) \nmore Photos (see all 13 | slideshow)  \n           \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverview\nDirector:Archie Mayo\n\nWriters:Joseph Fields (writer)\nRoland Kibbee (writer)\nmore \nRelease Date:10 May 1946 (USA) more \nGenre:Comedy more \nTagline:The Marx Brothers spend... more \nPlot:In post-war Casablanca, Ronald Kornblow is hired to run a hotel whose previous managers have all wound up being murdered... more | add synopsis \nPlot Keywords:Beautiful Woman | Hotel | Marx Brothers | Morocco | North Africa more \nUser Comments:Not one of their best, but still good. more \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCast (Complete credited cast)\n\n Groucho Marx ...

Whie plot was seldom an important thing to most Marx Brothers films, the one here is even less relevent than normal. This has more than its&amp;#039; share of moments. Several points are made sharply: 1) NEVER let Harpo take steps to get a stalled elevator going again! 2) don&amp;#039;t let Groucho check in guests as a desk clerk! 3)toupees and vacuum cleaners do not work and play well together! Recommended if you are a Marx Brothers fan. Others might be bored stiff. \nit in 10th place, I guess that&amp;#039;s something to cheer for. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e04ceed24c625bed1ca08bb88d588f0f678b0085","amp;dn":"MARX+BROTHERS+1938-1946.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e04ceed24c625bed1ca08bb88d588f0f678b0085","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,76,238,210,76,98,91,237,28,160,139,184,141,88,143,15,103,139,0,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
