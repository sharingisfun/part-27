As the neighbours gather in anticipation of the free food and drinks to be served after the funeral, strange things start to happen.\n\nWhen MammieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coffin refuses to be pulled up the hill to the grave, funeral attendees are forced to enlist the help of a cow. But with the weight of the coffin surpassing the animalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strength, the coffin is dropped, causing it to break open and MammieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s duppy to escape.\n\nFor unknown reasons, the ghost flees and takes over the property belonging to Miss Beatrice, the village dressmaker and self-professed non-believer in Ã¢â‚¬Å“duppy storiesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The presence of the unwanted guest forces Miss Beatrice to call on the local obeah-man, Bredda Zacky, to control the situation.\n\nMore humorous than it is scary, this Jamaican ghost story, written by skilled playwright, Aston Cooke, is an experience worth having.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49b032cb8d1471a8896dcf58b5e5997060b8c8d0","amp;dn":"COUNTRY.DUPPY.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49b032cb8d1471a8896dcf58b5e5997060b8c8d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,176,50,203,141,20,113,168,137,109,207,88,181,229,153,112,96,184,200,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
