I`ve noticed that a lot of good movies have slipped through the cracks of the ripping community. Some movies are no where to be found. If you are an avid movie collector, like myself, than you know exactly what I`m talking about. I am dedicated to bringing you all the good movies that you just can`t seem to find, so you can fill those unseemly holes in your collection. \nWhen it comes to quality, I have one golden rule: If I wouldn`t put it in my own collection, than I wouldn`t post it. \n\nInformation \n\nTitle...........[ The One \nDirector........[ James Wong \nLanguage........[ English \nRuntime.........[ 1:27:20 \nGenre...........[ Action \nIMDB Rating.....[ 5.4/10 http://imdb.com/title/tt0267804/ \nVideo...........[ Xvid 910 Kbps 23.976 fps \nAudio...........[ Dolby Digital AC3 6ch 128 Kbps \nResolution......[ 704 x 304 \nSubtitles.......[ None \nFile Size.......[ 828 MB \nSource..........[ Retail DVD NTSC \n\nCast \n\nJet Li...............Gabe Law / Gabriel Yulaw / Lawless \nCarla Gugino.........T.K.

And that all of these universes are held together by one single stream of energy and that energy is equally distributed to every living in each universe and if one of these beings die, that energy is reallocated equally to each other surviving member. And with each allocation, a person becomes stronger. Now one universe has master the ability of crossing into another universe, and a man named Shulaw who believes that if he can kill all of his counterparts, he will become invincible, but there are those who believe that it might have detrimental effects, so try and stop him. Unfortunately, he just has one more person to kill, Gabe Law, but the officers follow Shulaw but Shulaw has committed some crimes and Gabe is accused and is wanted. But Gabe discovers that he has changed and only wants to kill Shulaw not realizing what could happen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b022c631619aa6594d9d3b8ffb0f844d2a2b1cc","amp;dn":"The+One%5B2001%5Ddvdrip%5Bxvid+Ac3%5B5.1%5D+-+Insomniack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b022c631619aa6594d9d3b8ffb0f844d2a2b1cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,2,44,99,22,25,170,101,148,217,211,184,255,176,248,68,210,162,177,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
