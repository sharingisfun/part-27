These range from full concerts to fragments of as little as one or two songs.  Most are good quality, but lesser quality recordings may be used for patching, so there are drop-offs in sound quality at times.  And as with many live recordings there can be cuts and fade outs.  I'm not that sure about all the sources but I will try to make comments next to the below dates as to what I know.  This is a basic music only download if artwork is needed you could probably find what you need online at the Zeppelin Art site.\n\nThis isn't meant to be a definitive collection as there are many awesome Led Zeppelin performances in slightly lesser quality out there (for example 1969.01.05 whiskey a go go or 1971.09.29 Osaka).  I was merely trying to get together a collection of great sounding live Led Zeppelin for listening and figured others may like it as well.  So here it is if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re interested.
