Failed by the nation he served and weary of the skirmishes that plague the continent's principalities, he walks the land in search of purpose. He wants for little so bodyguard work keeps his belly full and his mage-gun loaded. It might never bring a man fame or wealth, but he's not forced to rely on others or kill without cause.\r\nLittle could compel Lynx to join a mercenary company, but he won't turn his back on a kidnapped girl. At least the job seems simple enough; the mercenaries less stupid and vicious than most he's met over the years.\r\nSo long as there are no surprises or hidden agendas along the way, it should work out fine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21d34179a8bee1239cff81bda44b152841c1443f","amp;dn":"Stranger+of+Tempest+Book+One+of+The+God+Fragments+-+%7BCHB+Books%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21d34179a8bee1239cff81bda44b152841c1443f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,211,65,121,168,190,225,35,156,255,129,189,164,75,21,40,65,193,68,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
