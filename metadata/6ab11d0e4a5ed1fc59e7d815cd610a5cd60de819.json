Originally published by DC until the Animal Man title switched over to Vertigo in '93, now through reprints the trade too has crossed over.\n\nThe much-demanded collection from writer Grant Morrison is back in print, in a new edition from VERTIGO! Morrison is all set to breathe new life into the X-Men, and has already helped revitalize the JLA, making it DC's #1 title. But before all that, Morrison produced a ground-breaking run on ANIMAL MAN that's since become a cult fan-favorite. Buddy Baker is more than just a second-rate super-hero. He's also a devoted husband, a loving father of two and a fierce animal activist. But just as he's attempting to jump-start his super-hero career again, his life takes some unexpected and bizarre turns.
