But don't let the file size fool you, the format is perfectly watchable and comparable to Youtube 360p.\n\n\nWelcome to the Recapstore.\n\n\n(Wikipedia) Star Wars is an American epic space opera franchise that consists of a film series created by George Lucas.\n\nThe first film in the series was originally released on May 25, 1977, under the title Star Wars, by 20th Century Fox, and became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon, followed by two sequels, released at three-year intervals. Sixteen years after the release of the trilogy's final film, the first in a new prequel trilogy of films was released. The three prequel films were also released at three-year intervals, with the final film released on May 19, 2005. Reactions to the original trilogy were mostly positive, with the last film being considered the weakest, while the prequel trilogy received a more mixed reaction, with most of the praise being for the final movie, according to most review aggregator websites. Some of the films in the series were also nominated for or won Academy Awards. A sequel trilogy was rumoured at one time but never materialised.\n\n.srt Subtitles included for the original trilogy.
