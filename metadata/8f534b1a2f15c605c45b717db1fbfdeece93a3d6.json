Every road trip requires a massive amount of coordination to haul the 150-person squad 20,000 miles a season. From feeding six-tons of men, to clothing and housing them, to how a stadium prepares and deals with more than 70,000 rabid fans, Travel Channel's cameras are there to capture this massive undertaking. In addition, viewers will see how the Cleveland Browns prepare each week through the eyes of the players and team management, including new owner Jimmy Haslam. They can expect to learn more about the history behind deeply-rooted team rivalries and other notable insights not typically covered in game-coverage news.\n\nCountry: USA\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 4 December 2012 (USA)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f534b1a2f15c605c45b717db1fbfdeece93a3d6","amp;dn":"NFL.Road.Tested.The.Cleveland.Browns.Ep1.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f534b1a2f15c605c45b717db1fbfdeece93a3d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,83,75,26,47,21,198,5,196,91,113,125,177,251,253,238,206,147,163,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
