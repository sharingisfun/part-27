Its title is the message left by the dolphins when they departed Planet Earth just before it was demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass, as described in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The phrase has since been adopted by some science fiction fans as a humorous way to say &quot;goodbye&quot; and a song of the same name was featured in the 2005 film adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\n\n=====================================================================================\n\nI put this together because I am a huge fan of Douglas Adams and the Hitchhikers &quot;trilogy&quot; but I could never find a propper rip of these audiobooks. Sure, there's plenty of rips in shitty, lossy mp3, but who the fuck wants that? FLAC gives you full loseless audio, and when you have audio books which are narrated by Stephen Fry and Martin Freeman, why would you want anything else?\nSo I bought all 5 audiobooks on cd, ripped each disc using Exact Audio Copy, logs and scans are included. Enjoy!\n\nAll I ask in return is that you #KeepSeeding! \n\n==========================================================================\n\nThousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. ~Siddhartha\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e53d1d17d14e6794c66637bf914218839507054a","amp;dn":"So+Long%2C+And+Thanks+For+All+The+Fish+%5B2006%5D+%5BFLAC%5D+%5BEAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e53d1d17d14e6794c66637bf914218839507054a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,61,29,23,209,78,103,148,198,102,55,191,145,66,24,131,149,7,5,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
