He's granted bail  \n                    but given an electronic tagging order and  \n                    curfew that applies to him residing with his  \n                    mother Ruth in her imposing mansion. At the  \n                    house, he is reunited with his younger   \n                    half-brother Paddy whose nihilistic attitude  \n                    and run-in with the police disturbs Cook who  \n                    realises the example he's set is not so funny  \n                    anymore. When Cook swaggers into college, he is  \n                    expelled on the spot for his brush with the  \n                    law. He is further humiliated by the intimacy  \n                    he witnesses between Freddie and Effy and then  \n                    goes to the police to confess to selling MDMA  \n                    to Sophia. Effy comes to visit Cook in the  \n                    Young Offenders Institution the day before the  \n                    trial to reveal her true feelings - but is it  \n                    Freddie or Cook that she really loves?   \n                                                         \n                                                                                                \n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n                     \n                        Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:571f8ee4bb3dfec6b3c6f392645fa6ca68b66d2a","amp;dn":"Skins.S04E03.HDTV.XviD-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"571f8ee4bb3dfec6b3c6f392645fa6ca68b66d2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,31,142,228,187,61,254,198,179,198,243,146,100,95,166,202,104,182,109,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
