Nothing corrupts our political system more than the ability of the rich and influential to spend limitless amounts of money Ã¢â‚¬â€ often in secret Ã¢â‚¬â€ with the intention of creating preferred political outcomes. And far from being a regulator of campaign finances, our political funding laws Ã¢â‚¬â€ aided by a corporate-friendly Supreme Court and self-interested politicians Ã¢â‚¬â€ only facilitate the process of empowering the few while subjugating the many.\n\nFew understand how money moves in and out of our political system better than campaign finance reform advocate Trevor Potter. A former chairman of the Federal Election Commission and founding president of the Campaign Legal Center, Potter was Stephen ColbertÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chief advisor when Colbert formed his own super PAC and 501 (c)(4) in a clever effort to expose the potential for chicanery behind each.\n\nBill and Potter discuss how American elections are bought and sold, who covers the cost, and how the rest of us pay the price.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I can assure you that if someone is spending millions of dollars to elect the candidate, the candidate knows where that money is coming from. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing illegal about telling them, but the voters arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t going to know that,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Potter tells Bill. Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re creating opportunities for corruption and candidates being beholden to specific private interests because of funding, yet thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no disclosure to the rest of us.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAlso on the show, a Bill Moyers essay on how the Citizens United decision has candidates campaigning for cash more than votes, and how that money is pouring into TV ads and high paid political consultants.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://billmoyers.com/episode/full-show-elections-for-sale/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://billmoyers.com/episode/full-show-elections-for-sale/&lt;/a&gt; (stream)\n\nshunster\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2de35c3cbd4744bfb66fb52bd3dcfa1ee400464","amp;dn":"Moyers+%26amp%3B+Company+%7E+Elections+for+Sale+2012+09+21+PBS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2de35c3cbd4744bfb66fb52bd3dcfa1ee400464","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,222,53,195,203,212,116,75,251,102,251,82,189,61,207,161,238,64,4,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
