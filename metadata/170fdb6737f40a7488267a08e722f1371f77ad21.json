Grigg (CRC, 2003).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 1-56670-573-8\r\n\r\nAccording to a report released by the Water Infrastructure Network (WIN), over the next 20 years America's water and wastewater systems will have to invest an additional $20 billion a year to replace aging and failing infrastructure in order to comply with the national environmental and public health priorities in the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. With this in mind, there is a need for a quick reference to help engineers, engineering managers, and non-engineering managers easily understand the framework under which water systems are conceived, designed, financed, constructed, operated, and maintained. Water, Wastewater, and Stormwater Infrastructure Management fills this need.\r\n\r\nThe text presents a coherent, integrated picture of water and sewer infrastructure management and provides comprehensive coverage of the latest research on management practices for water and sewer capital facilities with an emphasis on infrastructure. Taking a life-cycle approach to the management of physical capital facilities, this well-illustrated reference provides the how-tos for planning, budgeting, designing, constructing, and managing the physical infrastructure of water and sewer systems. The integrated presentation of topics allows for direct application of material to job-related functions.\r\n\r\nThe author covers current thinking on best management practices and provides vital information about regulatory requirements, codes and standards, and other management control mechanisms. Useful as a reference and a professional development guide, Water, Wastewater, and Stormwater Infrastructure Management delivers a simple and clear presentation of the material you will need to know in order to comply with national environmental and public health regulations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:170fdb6737f40a7488267a08e722f1371f77ad21","amp;dn":"Water%2C+Wastewater%2C+and+Stormwater+Infrastructure+Management","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"170fdb6737f40a7488267a08e722f1371f77ad21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,15,219,103,55,244,10,116,136,38,122,8,231,34,241,55,31,119,173,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
