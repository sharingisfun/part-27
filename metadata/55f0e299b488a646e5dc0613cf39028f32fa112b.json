What is the truth of Buddhism, its history and variety of practices? This vast and complex non-theistic religion in woven into the fabric of Asian civilisations for India to the Himalayan regions, China, Vietnam, Korea, Japan and elsewhere.Introducing Buddha describes the life and teachings of the Buddhia. Author Jane Hope, who has herself taught Buddhism extensively, also shows that enlightenment is a matter of experiencing the truth individually and by inspiration which is passed from teacher to student. Superbly illustrated by Borin Van Loon, the book illuminates this process through a rich legacy of stories, and explains the practices of meditation, Taoism and Zen. It goes on to describe the role of Buddhism in modern Asia and its growing influence on Western thought.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55f0e299b488a646e5dc0613cf39028f32fa112b","amp;dn":"Introducing+Buddha+-+Jane+Hope+%26amp%3B+Borin+Van+Loon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55f0e299b488a646e5dc0613cf39028f32fa112b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,240,226,153,180,136,166,70,229,220,6,19,207,57,2,143,50,250,17,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
