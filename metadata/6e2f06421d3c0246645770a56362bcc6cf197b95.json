I am pretty sure the factory installer\n        will work just fine located here:\n       &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.arma2.com/supply/game-updates&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.arma2.com/supply/game-updates&lt;/a&gt;\n        (The Arma 2: Combined Operations / Operation Arrowhead /\n        Reinforcements 1.50-1.60 update)\n        Alternatively you can choose to not download the v1.60 from this\n        torrent and use the one you may already have. I have left this\n        option open to your discretion.\n\n- At the end of the 1.60 patch it will again ask you to install the\n  Battlepack update thing - hit cancel = and the patch will finish.\n\n- Play Arma II/OA from the shortcut from your desktop.\n  NOTE: NO CRACK was EVER applied during this operation and works 100%\n        PERFECT.\n- Your done. GO FUCKING PLAY WITH NO CRASHES WHAT-SO-EVER!!!\n  NOTE: You will HAVE to start a new campaign because old saves are\n        incompatible with v1.60\n\n\nTESTED ON\n---------\n\nWindow 7 x64 Ultimate\nAMD Phenom II x4 965 Black Edition (@3.4Ghz - no OC)\nEVGA GTS 450 Superclocked Edition (no OC)\n8GB of G-Skill DDR3 1333's\n\nRunning @ MAX settings\n---\nV-sync: OFF\nPost Processing: Disabled (looks better to me)\nView Distance: 10,000 (set to 5,000 for flawless play)\n---\n---\nEditor Works 100%\nCampaigns work with no crashing 100%\nComes with new campaign Black Gauntlet - WOO-HOO!!\n---\nDid NOT test the server thing.
