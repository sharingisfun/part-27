That is until his womanizing ways catch up with him and he gets a much needed wake-up call. Just as he decides to clean up his act, the ultimate temptation enters his life.\n\nWhen Mackenzie Reed meets Brayden, the attraction is instant and she knows that together they could achieve the kind of career success sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always craved. But Mackenzie isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like most women. She has very good reasons for keeping her heart locked up tight. For her, this isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t about love. This is about power.\n\nSparks fly as Brayden and Mackenzie try to avoid the one thing neither of them wanted. Each must choose between the life theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve worked hard to achieve and the one they never imagined. Will they come to the same decision before itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too late? Or will a hidden threat keep them apart?\n\nGenre: Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5b99904d8a6a15737ca5ab17c326c56622968fe","amp;dn":"Chasing+Desire+by+Jennifer+Domenico","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5b99904d8a6a15737ca5ab17c326c56622968fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,185,153,4,216,166,161,87,55,202,90,177,124,50,108,86,98,41,104,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
