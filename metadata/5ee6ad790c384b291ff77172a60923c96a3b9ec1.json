On the strength of this the band were signed to Warp and in September 1998 released the single &amp;#039;plock&amp;#039;. This was tipped as one of the singles of the year by NME, Melody Maker, Dazed &amp; Confused etc.\n\nAn album For Beginner Piano was released in September 1999 to widespread critical acclaim...\n\nWebsite: http://www.movingunits.com/plone/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ee6ad790c384b291ff77172a60923c96a3b9ec1","amp;dn":"Plone+--+For+Beginner+Piano","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ee6ad790c384b291ff77172a60923c96a3b9ec1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,230,173,121,12,56,75,41,31,247,113,114,166,9,35,201,106,59,158,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
