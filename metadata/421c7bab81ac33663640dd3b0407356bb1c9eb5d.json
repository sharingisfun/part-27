The series was developed by Naughty Dog with a number of installments being outsourced to Ready at Dawn and High Impact Games. The first entry was one of the earliest titles released on the PlayStation 2, and the series is regarded as one of the console's defining franchises.\n\nThe games are considered story-based platformers that feature a mixture of action, racing and puzzle solving. The series is set in a fictional universe that incorporates science fantasy elements, and centers on the titular characters as they try to uncover the secrets of their world, and unravel the mysteries left behind by an ancient race of Precursors.\n\nThe first three games in the series were re-released on the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita as part of a remastered collection that includes support for the PlayStation Network and the PlayStation Suite. The remastered collection was handled by Mass Media Inc. with Naughty Dog assisting with the conversion of the games.[1] The series has also produced various forms of merchandise","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:421c7bab81ac33663640dd3b0407356bb1c9eb5d","amp;dn":"Jak+and+Daxter+Collection+PS2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"421c7bab81ac33663640dd3b0407356bb1c9eb5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,28,123,171,129,172,51,102,54,64,221,59,4,7,53,107,177,201,235,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
