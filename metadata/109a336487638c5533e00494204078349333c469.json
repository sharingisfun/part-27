Monsters! Bowlers!\n\nYou might be the best bowler in the world, but are you the best bowler in the Galaxy? Compete against humans, aliens and monsters in this interstellar twist on league bowling. It takes more than a good hook shot to compete in the Alien Monster Bowling League. Power moves, special balls and Whammies bring a whole new dimension to the lanes for a bowling experience that is out of this world!\n\nFeatures:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fearsome Competitors:\nTake to the lanes against various aliens and legendary monsters like werewolves, vampires, zombies and more! Each of your fearsome foes has a unique special bowling ability, so get ready for some big surprises!\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Galactic Bowling:\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never seen bowling like this. Unleash special throws with the Sonic Ball, Split Ball, Ghost Ball, Nitrous Ball and Clone Ball. Disrupt your opponents turn with Whammies that twist the lane, cause earthquakes, fire lasers and create other cosmic conundrums!\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Multiple Modes of Mayhem:\nFace off against progressively stranger league bowlers in Campaign Mode or jump right into Quick Play Mode. Challenge a friend in head-to-head multiplayer and take on a test of pure bowling skill without power-ups or Whammies in Regular Mode.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Stellar Controls:\nAim for the high score with intuitive controls that require only the Wii Remote. The Wii Motion Plus add-on is supported for the most authentic bowling experience to ever warp onto the console!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gametdb.com/Wii/SABENR&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gametdb.com/Wii/SABENR&lt;/a&gt;\n\nID......SABENR\nregion......NTSC\ntype......Wii\nlanguages......EN\ndeveloper......Perpetual FX Creative\npublisher......Data Design / Destineer Studios\nrelease date......2009-10-27\ngenre......sports, bowling\nrating......E10+\ncontent......suggestive themes, tobacco reference, mild cartoon violence\nplayers......2\nreq. accessories......wiimote\naccessories......motion plus\n\nMost of my 1500+ Wii games are listed here (not all yet).\n        \n        parts 1&amp;2 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://textuploader.com/koes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://textuploader.com/koes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://textuploader.com/oneu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://textuploader.com/oneu&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCheck it out and see if there's a game you want me to upload - add a request in the comments and i'll try to help out.\n\nIf you happen to have a game I do not, please upload it and let me know...Thanx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:109a336487638c5533e00494204078349333c469","amp;dn":"Alien+Monster+Bowling+League+%5BSABENR%5D+%28wbfs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"109a336487638c5533e00494204078349333c469","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,154,51,100,135,99,140,85,51,224,4,148,32,64,120,52,147,51,196,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
