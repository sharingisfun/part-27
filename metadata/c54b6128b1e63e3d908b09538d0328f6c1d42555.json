One such Diclonius, Lucy, is the main character of the series: Initially held in a facility built for experimentation, located off the coast of Kamakura, she manages to escape and wreak havoc, but is injured in the process, an event which causes her to develop a secondary, childlike personality known as Nyu.\n\nInfo:\nUploaded/Encoded By: Frozen_Solid [F-D]\nAudio: Eng/Jap\nQuality: Medium/High\nFormat: .mkv\nSubs: Eng\nEps: 13 + OVA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c54b6128b1e63e3d908b09538d0328f6c1d42555","amp;dn":"%5BF-D%5DElfen+lied+%5B480P%5D%5BDual-Audio%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c54b6128b1e63e3d908b09538d0328f6c1d42555","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,75,97,40,177,230,62,61,144,139,9,83,141,3,40,246,193,212,37,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
