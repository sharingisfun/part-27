She expects spells and magic -- not chores and ill-tempered nanny goats! Surely there must be more to witchcraft than this!\n\nWhat Tiffany doesn&amp;#039;t know is that an insidious, disembodied creature is pursuing her. This time, neither Mistress Weatherwax (the greatest witch in the world) nor the fierce, six-inch-high Wee Free Men can protect her. In the end, it will take all of Tiffany&amp;#039;s inner strength to save herself ... if it can be done at all.\n\nA Story of Discworld","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03e40f01298547f7dc8ea586f7951b4f3aecec15","amp;dn":"Terry+Pratchet+-+A+hat+full+of+Sky","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03e40f01298547f7dc8ea586f7951b4f3aecec15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,228,15,1,41,133,71,247,220,142,165,134,247,149,27,79,58,236,236,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
