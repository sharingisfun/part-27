The song is piano-driven and primarily uses three chords: F, B flat, and E flat, although a C is also played in the bridge section of the song. Also there is an A- flat that resolves back to the F before the next verse. The song garnered The White Stripes a 2006 Grammy nomination for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.\n\nThis video for the single was directed by The Malloys, filmed in black-and-white, and features Jack and Meg performing in front of a crowd of children. The video premiered on August 19, 2005 on Nickelodeon following an episode of Unfabulous that featured Jack and Meg White.\n(video does not have any logos) \n\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Doorbell&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Doorbell&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/gAbKpAade&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/gAbKpAade&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 7200kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 448kbps\n   Duration: 00:04:36\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
