He declined to disclose the amount but said it was seven figures.\n\nSavage has been given ownership of his show, according to Horowitz, which means he will be off the air until he signs a contract with a new syndicator.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Within an hour of knowing he was free, we were already talking to top names in the business,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Horowitz said.\n\nWND contacted TRN, but a staffer said no one in a position to comment was available.\n\nGet SavageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s free weekly insider newsletter five days a week in your email inbox by going to the top of the home page on SavageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s website and clicking the green Ã¢â‚¬Å“SUBSCRIBEÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ box.\n\nAs WND reported, the new Talk Stream Live Ã¢â‚¬Å“Power 50,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which ranks the top talk-radio shows streaming on the Web, had Savage in the No. 2 spot.\n\nTalk Stream Live says it sampled more than 1.2 million listeners during the first six months of the year to produce Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Power 50 ReportÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the 50 most influential talk show hosts on the Internet and on mobile devices.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“We are proud to report that Rush Limbaugh is No. 1 and Michael Savage is No. 2,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said TSL. Ã¢â‚¬Å“These are the most listened to talk show hosts in the world.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nMore to follow Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Download, seed, and spread the word. \n\n\nMore Stuff is here\nRush, Michael Savage, Mark Levin, Dennis Prager\nthepiratebay . se / user / CAPTAIN7SS/0/3\nbeta . demonoid . me / files / ?seeded=2&amp;uid=7492662\n\nRush Shows and Neal Boortz Shows Live are here\nthepiratebay . se / user / amuck5 /\n\nLaura Ingraham podcasts are here\nthepiratebay . se / user / freedomczar /\n\nGlenn Beck Insider podcasts are here\nthepiratebay . se / search / glenn%20beck/0/99/100\n\nPodcasts of the Rush Limbaugh Show are here (temporarily stopped uploading)\nthepiratebay . se / user / Annoyme /","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c051169c34078286c90d114097767afa659672cd","amp;dn":"The+Michael+Savage+Radio+Show+SEP-27-2012+THURS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c051169c34078286c90d114097767afa659672cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,81,22,156,52,7,130,134,201,13,17,64,151,118,122,250,101,150,114,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
