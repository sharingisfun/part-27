It seems that only Kaiju spoof films are coming out of Japan these days. It's new and fun to watch but you will hope for a Godzilla or Gamera franchise to start again.\n\nI am not sure where the original torrent was posted, I got this from Mininova and now it is missing. Respects to whoever posted wherever!
