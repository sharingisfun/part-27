A self-titled &quot;musician, poet, and media manipulator&quot; continues to be one of the most interesting phenomena on music scene(s) of the former Yugoslavia.\n\nHis songs combine satirical lyrics on the nature of common people and silliness of local politics. He uses a mixture of musical styles including jazz and Rock (converging towards drum and bass lately), and self-conscious ironic wit (for example, one of his aliases is &quot;Rambo Amadeus Svjetski Mega Car&quot; (RASMC) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Rambo Amadeus World Mega Tzar&quot;). His stage name itself is made from John Rambo and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Known also as a &quot;charming king of jovial pop&quot;, his concerts are never mere repetitions of recorded songs, but a mixture of musical improvisation and humor exploiting all aspects of human nature in a crude manner. Some fans compare his style and career path with those of Frank Zappa or Captain Beefheart.\n\nHipishizik Metafizik is a studio album released in 2008.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:395719c68d24409545c8d2fadf27c392ceb1c321","amp;dn":"Rambo+Amadeus+-+Hipishizik+Metafizik","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"395719c68d24409545c8d2fadf27c392ceb1c321","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,87,25,198,141,36,64,149,69,200,210,250,223,39,195,146,206,177,195,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
