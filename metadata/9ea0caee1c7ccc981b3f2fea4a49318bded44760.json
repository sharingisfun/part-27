Fresh pink garlic takes centre stage in a simple take on a French classic, chicken with 40 cloves of garlic - in true Nigella style it's one hundred per cent one-pot wonder.\n\nThere's chocolate, of course, in moist gooey brownies that are effortless, easy and use everyday ingredients. If you ever need cakes in a hurry these brownies are the answer. Chili is Nigella's final food hero - perfect in a fiery chorizo and chick pea stew you can rustle up from the pantry in no time at all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ea0caee1c7ccc981b3f2fea4a49318bded44760","amp;dn":"Nigella.Kitchen.S01E09.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ea0caee1c7ccc981b3f2fea4a49318bded44760","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,160,202,238,28,124,204,152,27,63,47,234,74,73,49,139,222,212,71,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
