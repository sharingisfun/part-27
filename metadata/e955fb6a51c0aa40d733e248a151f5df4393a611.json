ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a refreshing combination of adventure and pathos that is neither cliche nor a spoof. The Jam is an original.\n\nThe star of this series is Kenny, a nice young man who decided one day to alter a Sears thermal jogging suit and go fight crime. Never mind that he had no training, no super-powers, or for that matter, no deep, dark trauma that transformed him into a living weapon. No, Kenny just liked the suit. That alone seemed to be enough to lead him into one adventure after another. Soon Kenny was stopping muggers, protecting corrupt sheiks, taking on assassin cults, and braving other hazards of urban life. Sadly, he also lost his girlfriend, who couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take the craziness anymore (and had been having Kirby-esque dreams featuring Kenny and the Devil). \n\nThese Tundra issues are a colorized re-issue of the original five issue series distributed by Slave Labor. (Sorry but I couldn't find them in any of my boxes in the house and didn't have any energy to look through the garage).\n\nPart two of the series was released by Dark Horse in B&amp;W (coming soon to a torrent site near you) and then the third episode was released by Caliber Press and there was a colored one-shot by Comico.\n\nPlease let me know if you find any errors and I will fix, there are some streaking on some of the pages in the last issue, I tried to clean up as well as I could but I'm not that proficient in photoshop.\n\nENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e955fb6a51c0aa40d733e248a151f5df4393a611","amp;dn":"Tundra+-+The+Jam%3A+Urban+Adventure+%281992+Series%29+-+Bernie+Mireaul","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e955fb6a51c0aa40d733e248a151f5df4393a611","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,85,251,106,81,192,170,64,215,51,226,72,161,81,245,223,67,147,166,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
