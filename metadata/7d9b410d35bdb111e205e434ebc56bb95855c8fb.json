Fletcher (Chevy Chase), who writes under the name of Jane Doe. The film was based on the popular Gregory Mcdonald novels, the screenplay was written by Andrew Bergman and it was directed by Michael Ritchie.\n\nThe film opens with one of Fletch's many, often humorous, monologues. The drug trade is Fletch's latest story, and while investigating undercover as a beach wanderer one day he is approached by a well-groomed man, Alan Stanwyk (Tim Matheson). Stanwyk says he wants Fletch to murder him because he has inoperable cancer; this way his family will receive his life insurance. Unaware that Fletch is actually an undercover reporter, Stanwyk thinks he would be the perfect man for the job, as he appears to be a person of no consequence who can thus simply disappear after the shooting without any suspicions being raised. Fletch agrees to kill Stanwyk when offered a considerable sum of money, but is suspicious of Stanwyk's motives. Fletch starts to dig and uncovers a story much greater than his exposÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© of small-time drug dealers. As he uncovers the lurid truth about Stanwyk, he also discovers that a sinister police chief (Joe Don Baker) is behind the drug trafficking on Los Angeles' beaches.\n\n\n\nLanguage: English\nSubs:     English, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish\nAspect Ratio: 1.78:1 \nWidescreen: 16:9\nPAL\n\n\nUntouched\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d9b410d35bdb111e205e434ebc56bb95855c8fb","amp;dn":"Fletch++%281985%29++DVD-R+++PAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d9b410d35bdb111e205e434ebc56bb95855c8fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,155,65,13,53,189,177,17,226,5,228,52,235,197,107,185,88,85,200,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
