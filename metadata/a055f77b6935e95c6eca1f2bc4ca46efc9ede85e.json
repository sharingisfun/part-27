For more information on Extreme please read about them on wikipedia:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_(band)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_(band)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI have made this discography and I have included all the main albums for them plus the new live album. These are all you need really, there's also the 2 main compilations included. The reason I'm sharing Extreme is because they're again another funky kind of band though they're really a hard rock band but they have funky elements to their music and they're a favourite of mine since years ago.\n\nThe tracks are the usual MP3 quality @ 320kbps CBR/44.1Khz. I've made sure they're all tagged right and also included the album artwork both with each one plus the artwork tagging also.\n\nPlease please help me to seed this as much as you can, I want to it grow and then lots of people can all grab it. Extreme are a great band and they're worth sharing, the guitarist Nuno is a favourite of mine, he's really great as a musician and all their music is well worth listening to again and again!\n\nHope you enjoy this torrent!
