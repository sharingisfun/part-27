But resolving the job-versus-life conflict doesn't require the kind of big, disruptive, scary transformation that so many time-management &quot;experts&quot; recommend. In TWEAK IT, Cali Williams Yost proves that a comfortable work+life fit can be achieved through making small, consistent, everyday changes--tweaks--that, cumulatively, will optimize job performance and well-being. This engaging, practical book, filled with case studies of people who've tweaked their way to professional success and personal satisfaction, guides readers through an easy-to-implement program that can be tailored to suit any individual's life, both on off the job.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5500d64e80de966420649fa9d67f513343438cc9","amp;dn":"Tweak+It%3A+Make+What+Matters+to+You+Happen+Every+Day","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5500d64e80de966420649fa9d67f513343438cc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,0,214,78,128,222,150,100,32,100,159,169,214,127,81,51,67,67,140,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
