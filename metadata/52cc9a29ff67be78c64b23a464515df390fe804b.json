Marking a move away from Chatwin's signature guitar sound into a wide-ranging electronic sound palette, featuring his most direct and uncompromising work to date. The album was born when Daniel Crossley, owner of Fluid Radio met with Ben in late 2010. The pair visited areas in East London where Daniel had lived for much of his life, also the same area Ben found himself living. They shared stories and memories, looking back at a past that featured loss, isolation, addiction and abuse. Eaten Alive is the result of this encounter, as Chatwin looks both introspectively and into the community where events like this can so readily happen. An album that focuses on the darker recesses of life, where bold melodic ideas fight with harsh noise and glacial ambiance to create something organic, evolving and physically arresting.
