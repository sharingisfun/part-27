Previously we brought you the 26th    \n  competition, now we are back with an even better HDTV source.         \n                                                                        \n  Yes, its pure Japanese audio, but English speaking Ninja Warrior      \n  fans will have little difficulty following the competition. We find   \n  watching raw sasuke more engaging then its English edited             \n  counterpart - Ninja Warrior.                                          \n                                                                        \n  A note on editing: Sasuke uses an unusual 'overlaped' type of         \n  advertising placement. Through careful editing its possibe to edit    \n  most ads out seamlessly so that you won't even notice there was an    \n  ad break (the breaks usually occur during action scenes).             \n                                                                        \n  Enjoy this quality release, and for the hardcore fans check out our   \n  720p HD version of this!                                              \n                                                                        \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasuke_%28TV_series%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasuke_%28TV_series%29&lt;/a&gt;                   \n                                                                        \n  PS.
