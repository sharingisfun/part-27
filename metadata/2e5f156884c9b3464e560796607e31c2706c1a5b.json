In Crogan's Vengeance, &quot;Catfoot&quot; Crogan is an able-bodied mariner plying his trade for a dastardly &quot;legitimate&quot; captain with a grudge against Crogan for a slight committed well before he was born. But when his ship is taken by pirates, will Crogan stay loyal to his law-abiding, if despicable, captain or will he find a new life on the high seas living by the &quot;Pirate's Code&quot;?\nA pirate story with lots of attention to history and no toning down the violence, but in a highly stylized B&amp;W form that makes it readable by all ages.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e5f156884c9b3464e560796607e31c2706c1a5b","amp;dn":"Crogan%26rsquo%3Bs+Vengeance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e5f156884c9b3464e560796607e31c2706c1a5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,95,21,104,132,201,179,70,78,86,7,150,96,126,49,194,112,108,26,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
