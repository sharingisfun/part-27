SQL is a declarative language in which the expected result or operation is given without the specific details about how\nto accomplish the task. The steps required to execute SQL statements are handled transparently by the SQL database. Sometimes SQL is characterized as non-procedural because procedural languages generally require the details of the operations to be specified, such as opening and closing tables, loading and searching indexes, or flushing buffers and writing data to filesystems. Therefore, SQL is considered to be designed at a higher conceptual level of operation than procedural languages because the lower level logical and physical operations aren't specified and are determined by the SQL engine or server process that executes it.\n\nBook Details :\n\nTitle :  Structured Query Language_Print version.pdf\nFormat : pdf\nPages : 44\nSize : 1.1 Mb\n\nFollow us on facebook...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.&lt;/a&gt; facebook. com/ torrentsharing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:667b545fb334046d803eca8fe6d4e7d1b3cdd2bb","amp;dn":"+Structured+Query+Language_Print+version.pdf+%7B+UPPOG2+%7D+torrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"667b545fb334046d803eca8fe6d4e7d1b3cdd2bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,123,84,95,179,52,4,109,128,62,202,143,230,212,231,209,179,205,210,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
