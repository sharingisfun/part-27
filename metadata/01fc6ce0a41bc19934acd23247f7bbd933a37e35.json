Each person carries a story, this is one of them and I didn't know at the time but this story is also mine.&quot; American reporter Sofie (Stone) has just got a big break in the story she is working on. Excited she calls her brother and hears gun shots. Trying to find out what happened leads her to Mexico and a ring of human smuggling and violence. From there things get more and more dangerous, and it's all true. I will start by saying that this was better then I was expecting. While still a B type movie the acting wasn't bad and the movie really made you feel strong emotions. One of them is anger toward the smugglers, the other is anger toward the border guards. To me the movie made me feel mixed emotions. Anger toward the smugglers and anger toward the US policies as well as agreeing with the policies. I wasn't sure who is in the right in this movie and that's what makes a good movie. One that makes you feel something you didn't before. I recommend it for that reason, but the movie itself is just OK. Overall, the emotions you feel make the movie well worth seeing. I say B.\n\n\nRemember to seed so others can get the same enjoyment of the movie that you've got.\nKeep in mind I can not give full speed to all, so if you're one of the lucky ones, help seed.\n\nAnd remember, because I upload in winRAR files, it does not mean that it is &quot;VIRUS&quot;.\n \nPress my name &quot;Realuploads&quot; and see my other uploads before you write crap.\n\n\n\nGreetings Realuploads\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01fc6ce0a41bc19934acd23247f7bbd933a37e35","amp;dn":"Border+Run+%28+Hardcoded+Dk+subs+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01fc6ce0a41bc19934acd23247f7bbd933a37e35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,252,108,224,164,27,193,153,52,172,210,50,71,247,187,217,51,163,126,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
