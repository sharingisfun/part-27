Often, it felt like all of his energy went into a couple of songs per album, since the remainder of each record, while frequently enjoyable, was cluttered with filler. Which is a roundabout way of saying what a welcome addition Greatest Hits: The Sound of Money is to Money&amp;#039;s catalog: not only is it a fine collection of his hits, it&amp;#039;s the most consistent record he&amp;#039;s assembled. Not that it&amp;#039;s perfect. Some of his smaller hits are missing and there&amp;#039;s a bit of filler even on this hits disc, but the truly essential items -- &quot;Baby Hold On,&quot; &quot;Two Tickets to Paradise,&quot; &quot;I Wanna Go Back,&quot; &quot;Walk on Water,&quot; &quot;Shakin&amp;#039;,&quot; &quot;Take Me Home Tonight,&quot; &quot;Think I&amp;#039;m in Love,&quot; even &quot;Peace in Our Time&quot; -- are here, and the best of them really do define what album-rock was all about at the turn of the &amp;#039;70s and early &amp;#039;80s. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c20c25667381293fb33720a84363acfa2032aa92","amp;dn":"Eddie+Money+Greatest+Hits","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c20c25667381293fb33720a84363acfa2032aa92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,12,37,102,115,129,41,63,179,55,32,168,67,99,172,250,32,50,170,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
