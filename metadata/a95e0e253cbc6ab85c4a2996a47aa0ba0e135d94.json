As a composer, he acted as a bridge between the 19th century Austro-German tradition and the modernism of the early 20th century. While in his lifetime his status as a conductor was established beyond question, his own music gained wide popularity only after periods of relative neglect which included a ban on its performance in much of Europe during the Nazi era. After 1945 the music was discovered and championed by a new generation of listeners; Mahler then became one of the most frequently performed and recorded of all composers, a position he has sustained into the 21st century.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a95e0e253cbc6ab85c4a2996a47aa0ba0e135d94","amp;dn":"Mahler%2C+Symphony+No.9%2C+Philharmonia+Orchestra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a95e0e253cbc6ab85c4a2996a47aa0ba0e135d94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,94,14,37,60,188,106,184,92,74,41,150,164,122,160,186,14,19,93,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
