AVRO's &quot;TopPop&quot; was the first weekly pop program broadcast on Dutch television. It ran from September 22, 1970 to June 27, 1988.\n\n&quot;TopPop&quot; was mainly filled with pop artists in the top pop studio, playing to their latest hit. During the years of 1970-1974, 1978-1981 and 1986-1988, the artists were selected by the choice of the Viewer. In the years 1974-1978 and 1981-1986, the National Charts were used instead.\n\n&quot;Kids in America&quot; is a New Wave song by British singer Kim Wilde, released in the United Kingdom as her debut single in January 1981, and in the US in 1982.\n\nThe song was recorded in 1980 after RAK Records boss Mickie Most heard Wilde singing on a backing track for her brother Ricky Wilde. He liked her voice and image and expressed an interest to work with her. Ricky Wilde, together with his father Marty Wilde (who is a 1950s/1960s rock and roll star) wrote the song &quot;Kids in America&quot; for Wilde to record. Once the demo was sent, Most remixed the track himself and released it on RAK as Wilde's first single in January 1981.\n(video does not have any logos) \n\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_in_America_(song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_in_America_(song)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toppop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toppop&lt;/a&gt; \n\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/gABKcAADE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/gABKcAADE&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG4 Video 768x576 25.00fps 3444kbps\n   Audio: AAC 48000Hz stereo stereo 165kbps\n   Duration: 00:02:47\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
