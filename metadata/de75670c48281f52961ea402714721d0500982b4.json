Drag and drop on audacity; align properly by checking with magnification. Upload your creativity on torrents.\n\nSome Weapon sounds thrown in just for fun. You can probably use this during sound testing too.\n\nMusic works with 1.0.4.756 and probably above.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de75670c48281f52961ea402714721d0500982b4","amp;dn":"music+for+VGHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de75670c48281f52961ea402714721d0500982b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,117,103,12,72,40,31,82,150,30,164,2,113,71,33,208,80,9,130,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
