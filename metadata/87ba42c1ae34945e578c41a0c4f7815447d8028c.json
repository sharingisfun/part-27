It was released on the Xbox 360 video game console exclusively on September 22, 2009, nearly two years after the initial release of Halo 3. Players assume the roles of elite human United Nations Space Command soldiers known as Orbital Drop Shock Troopers (ODSTs) during the events of Halo 2 and Halo 3. After the alliance of alien races known as the Covenant attacks Earth, the player explores the ruined city of New Mombasa to discover what happened to their missing teammates, separated from each other as they entered the city.\n\nBungie initially conceived ODST as a small side project to produce in the lull between Halo 3's completion and Halo: Reach. Instead of featuring recognizable characters such as the Master Chief from previous games, the developers focused on the ODSTs. Story director Joseph Staten penned a detective story utilizing film noir settings, design, and characters. Composer Martin O'Donnell abandoned his previous Halo themes to create a quieter, jazz-influenced sound. During development, the game grew in scope to that of a full-sized game.[2]\n\nUpon release, ODST became the top-selling Xbox 360 game worldwide. The title received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the atmosphere, music, and story approach. Reviewers were divided on whether the relatively short campaign and included extras were enough to justify the game's US$60 price tag. The game was the top-selling title in the United States in September 2009 and has sold more than 3 million copies.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n                              \n                                    UPDATE\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                         PASSWORD: gameguide_-_curtiz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87ba42c1ae34945e578c41a0c4f7815447d8028c","amp;dn":"HALO_3_ODST_OFFICIAL+GUIDE_HISPEED_GLMC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87ba42c1ae34945e578c41a0c4f7815447d8028c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,186,66,193,174,52,148,94,87,140,65,160,196,247,129,84,71,216,2,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
