The album was recorded at the same time as Aguilera\nwas recording her Spanish-language album Mi ReflejoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½the albums were released one month apart.\nThe album sold well, going platinum in the U.S. and selling over three million copies worldwide.\n\n&quot;Christmas Time&quot; was shipped to radio in mid-November 2000 and served as the first\n(and only) single to be released off the album, though not receiving any video treatment.\n\nIronically the track &quot;Merry Christmas, Baby&quot; entered the Billboard Hot Ringtones\nat number thirty-eight in December 2007.\n\n\nReview by Stephen Thomas Erlewine allmusic\n\n\n\n\nChristmas appeared on the shelves two months after Mi Reflejo, Christina's Latin reworking of her\ndebut album. My Kind of Christmas actually has more new material than Mi Reflejo, and Aguilera\nresponds in kind, turning in passionate performances throughout the 11-song album.\nShe can teeter on the edge of being too passionate, belting out when she should lay back,\nbut the power of her voice, no matter how diva-esque she may be, remains remarkable;\nshe needs to learn restraint, but she's clearly a better singer than her peers. Of course,\nMy Kind of Christmas remains a holiday album, filled with covers of standards\n(from &quot;Oh Holy Night&quot; to &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; to &quot;Merry Christmas, Baby&quot;) and a handful of\nobligatory new songs. None of the new songs are knockouts, but &quot;Christmas Time&quot; and &quot;This Year&quot;\nare pretty solid pieces of dance-pop, even if the marvelously titled &quot;Xtina's Xmas&quot; (easily the\nbest name of any new holiday song of 2000) is a 90-second collage trifle that doesn't\nlive up to its promise. But, hey -- filler is part of a holiday record, and there's actually not\ntoo much of it here. Instead, it's pretty tight, entertaining seasonal dance-pop. It may not add\ntoo much to Christina's catalog, but it does suggest that she may not be a mere one-album wonder.\n\n\n\n1. (04:02) - Christmas Time\n2. (04:14) - This Year\n3.
