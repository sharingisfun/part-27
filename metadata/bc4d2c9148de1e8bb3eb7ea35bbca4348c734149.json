Co-produced once again by Ben Kersten at Paradise Sound studios in Index, WA (located in the foothills of the Cascades), the album is a little darker and more subdued than their 2008 debut. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also drop-dead gorgeous, with airy production highlighting the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sublime harmonies\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc4d2c9148de1e8bb3eb7ea35bbca4348c734149","amp;dn":"Grand+Archives+-+Keep+In+Mind+Frankenstein+%5B2009%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc4d2c9148de1e8bb3eb7ea35bbca4348c734149","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,77,44,145,72,222,30,139,179,235,126,163,91,188,164,52,140,115,65,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
