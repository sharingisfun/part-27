It unveils a recurring historical conflict between two logics of factory management and organization: workshop principles and principles of a standardized factory. Case studies of &quot;Flexible Manufacturing Systems&quot; in these four countries and their sociopolitical contexts show national variations and tensions between factory and workshop principles continuing into the age of computerization.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa235871fdb19cc3dbe170d37e8545e5fba39270","amp;dn":"Forcing+the+Factory+of+the+Future","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa235871fdb19cc3dbe170d37e8545e5fba39270","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,35,88,113,253,177,156,195,219,225,112,211,126,133,69,229,251,163,146,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
