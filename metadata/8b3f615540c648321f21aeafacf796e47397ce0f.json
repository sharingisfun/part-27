Though the Osbornes were past their creative peak, they were experiencing a commercial revival during this era. Much of this music ranks among the duo's most enjoyable music, and any serious Osborne Brothers fan will need to invest in this excellent set. ~ Thom Owens","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b3f615540c648321f21aeafacf796e47397ce0f","amp;dn":"The+Osborne+Brothers+1968-1974++%5BBear+Family+4+disc+set%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b3f615540c648321f21aeafacf796e47397ce0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,63,97,85,64,198,72,50,31,33,174,175,172,247,150,228,115,151,206,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
