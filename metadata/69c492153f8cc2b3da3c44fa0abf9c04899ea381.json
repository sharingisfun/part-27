(Not that the words in many of these songs support what I'm saying). This is hauntingly beautiful stuff that is somehow more natural sounding than many English folk albums at the moment and compares very favouably with that classic of the genre, No Roses by Shirley Collins with The Albion Band. \n\nIt may not become a classic but this lady is capable of producing one in the future so I'm saving my 5 star review for that. \n\nIf you love English folk music created by artists who so obviously love music making for the sake of the music, download and listen to this with confidence.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/10/26/jackie-oates/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69c492153f8cc2b3da3c44fa0abf9c04899ea381","amp;dn":"Jackie+Oates...Jackie+Oates%282006%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69c492153f8cc2b3da3c44fa0abf9c04899ea381","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,196,146,21,63,140,194,179,218,60,68,250,10,191,156,4,137,158,163,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
