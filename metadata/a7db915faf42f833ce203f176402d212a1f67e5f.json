Rare breed pig farmer Jimmy Doherty has a dream to make free range food affordable for everyone. So he's challenged Britain's biggest supermarket, Tesco, to let him prove he can do it, and they've agreed. Animal welfare standards might have come a long way in the UK, but most of the country's chickens are still reared intensively, 60% of pigs still spend their whole lives in sheds, and tens of thousands of dairy calves are needlessly slaughtered each year because it's too expensive to rear them. Jimmy's taking on three of Tesco's best-selling own brand products and will work with the company to try and make higher-welfare versions for the same affordable price. If he's successful, they'll launch them in their stores.\n\n\n\n2)  Sausages \nJimmy takes on Tesco's best-selling own brand sausages - which sell in their millions - to see if he can produce a free -range version for the same affordable price. He visits Tesco supplying farms to find out how they make their sausages, and looks for ways to use pigs reared to higher welfare standards in his own bangers. He seeks out the cheap cuts and parts of free-range pigs (such as offal) that would otherwise go to waste or be exported abroad. Can he convince Tesco that a free-range sausage made from offal will go down well with the public?\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img839.imageshack.us/img839/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img839.imageshack.us/img839/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img266.imageshack.us/img266/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img266.imageshack.us/img266/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img72.imageshack.us/img72/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img72.imageshack.us/img72/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img403.imageshack.us/img403/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img403.imageshack.us/img403/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img337.imageshack.us/img337/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img337.imageshack.us/img337/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img267.imageshack.us/img267/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img267.imageshack.us/img267/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 2068 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 48.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 3\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Doherty_%28farmer%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Doherty_%28farmer%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7db915faf42f833ce203f176402d212a1f67e5f","amp;dn":"Ch4+Jimmy+And+The+Giant+Supermarket+2of3+Sausages+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7db915faf42f833ce203f176402d212a1f67e5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,219,145,95,175,66,248,51,206,32,63,23,100,2,210,18,161,246,126,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
