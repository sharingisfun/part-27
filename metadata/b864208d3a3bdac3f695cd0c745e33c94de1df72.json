The starting line up \nwas brothers Daniel and Jeremy Swain on bass and guitar with Brandon \nForbes on drums. Daniel soon took over the drums and Brandon left the \nband. This was the first of many changes. The first year or two Jeremy and \nDaniel remained while many members came and went including guitarists Joe \nMeasner and Josh Arney, and bassist Jon Muraski. At one point Josh Childers \njoined the band as a bass player but quit after a few shows. Travis Bailey \nand best pal David Bunton left their band &quot;Upsideout&quot; to join up as Bass \nplayer and Lead Vocalist respectively. Dave sang in a pop/punk voice, very \ndifferent from his style of singing today. Josh Childers rejoined as a second \nguitarist making the band a quintet but shortly thereafter, Jeremy, who had \nstarted the band and had up to that point been the primary songwriter, left \nthe band for personal reasons. Josh Childers assumed the role of primary \nsongwriter and the band continued on. For the next couple years this group \nplayed locally and recorded from time to time but never released a full-length \nalbum. Eventually Travis moved to guitar/occasional songwiter and Eric \nKoruchak joined the band as Bass player.\n\nOver time longtime metalhead Josh&amp;#039;s metal influences saw 2540 morph from \npunk to metal. This change in style prompted a change of the band&amp;#039;s name to \n&quot;Showdown&quot; (or &quot;The Showdown&quot; depending on who you ask). In 2003, \nDaniel left the band to get married at which time Andrew Hall took the \ndrumming position. With Andrew on board the fivesome headed to the studio \nand recorded their first Full length album A Chorus of Obliteration. This \nalbum, produced by Bruce Fitzhugh, lead singer of Living Sacrifice, was mainly \na mix of Hardcore and Metal. After a great deal of touring in both the US and \nEurope, Showdown went back to the studio to record their second full length \nalbum. This album took a different direction trading in the screaming double-\nbassing death metal for a more southern approach mixed with elements of \ntheir older style Such as heavy guitar riffs, some screams (although not as \ndominated by them), and amazing bass and drum lines, drawing also from \n1980s to early 1990s-era metal like Pantera, Iron Maiden, Megadeth, and \nMetallica.\n\nIn late 2006, after completing the album, Andrew announced he was leaving \nthe band to get married (and possibly to pursue a career in professional \nwrestling - or so the rumor goes). Andrew was soon replaced by another \nAndrew - A.J. Barrette of Still Remains. Although the album was already \ncompleted. The Showdown along with A.J. hit the studio once more to record \nthe track &quot;Head Down&quot; which would be added to the album before its release. \nThe Completed Album, Temptation Come My Way was released on February \n20, 2007. Unknown to the public until release, two different versions were \nreleased, one with the song &quot;Fanatics and Whores&quot;, and one without; \nprobably to avoid controversy in the Christian market. This upset many fans \nwho had pre-ordered the CD and received the incomplete album, even \nthough most distributors list the song in their track listing. Temptation Come \nmy Way received high popularity in the underground culture, and The \nShowdown was soon signed in March 21st of 2007 to play at Ozzfest 07.\n\nAfter extensive touring and popular reception, the band announced on their \nmyspace they had begun recording their next album on January 2008. On \nApril 19, 2008, the Showdown completed their new album entitled Back \nBreaker and will soon be going on the Shadows Fall tour to promote Back \nBreaker. The Showdown is releasing Back Breaker through Solid State \nRecords. The band now consists of only four members. Back Breaker will be \nAugust 19th, 2008 through Solid State Records.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b864208d3a3bdac3f695cd0c745e33c94de1df72","amp;dn":"The+Showdown+-+A+Chorus+Of+Obliteration+%5B2004%5D%5BFLAC%5D-FLAWL3SS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b864208d3a3bdac3f695cd0c745e33c94de1df72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,100,32,141,58,59,218,195,246,149,205,12,116,94,51,201,77,225,223,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
