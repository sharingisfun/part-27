With a hand-picked rhythm section consisting of pianist Claude Williamson, bassist Buddy Clark, and drummer Mel Lewis, and three originals contributed by each of the two leaders, everything gels nicely, though several tracks took more than three takes (in spite of liner note writer Nat Hentoff's assertions) to reach their final form. Mulligan contributed the gorgeous ballad &quot;What's the Rush&quot; (where he sat back to enjoy Hodges' solo and never plays his own horn), the easygoing swinger &quot;Bunny,&quot; and the brisk cooker &quot;18 Carrots (For Rabbit),&quot; the latter which its composer would revisit with his Concert Jazz Band. The veteran alto saxophonist contributed the low-key ballad &quot;Shady Side,&quot; the sassy blues &quot;Back Beat&quot; (later re-recorded by Hodges during a still unreleased 1960 studio meeting with Ben Webster), and &quot;What It's All About,&quot; another potent blues. Throughout the date, the two saxophonists blend beautifully and complement one another's efforts, even though this was their only opportunity to record together in the studio. Sadly, no alternate takes or unissued numbers (at least two of which exist) have been added to this long anticipated reissue. ~ Ken Dryden, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nGerry Mulligan (Baritone Saxophone) \nJohnny Hodges (Alto Saxophone) \nClaude Williamson (Piano) \nBuddy Clark (Double Bass) \nMel Lewis (Drums) \n\nGerry Mulligan Meets Johnny Hodges Tracks:\n01  Bunny (Gerry Mulligan) 5:47 \n02  What's The Rush (Judy Holliday/Gerry Mulligan) 3:45 \n03  Back Beat (Johnny Hodges) 7:28 \n04  What's It All About (Johnny Hodges) 4:02 \n05  18 Carrots For Rabbit (Gerry Mulligan) 5:16 \n06  Shady Side (Johnny Hodges) 7:04","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3d266ae384d7a25cfcea32136d6f08b057d94c0","amp;dn":"Gerry+Mulligan+-+Gerry+Mulligan+Meets+Johnny+Hodges+%281959%29+%5BJazz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3d266ae384d7a25cfcea32136d6f08b057d94c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,210,102,174,56,77,122,37,207,206,163,33,54,214,240,139,5,125,148,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
