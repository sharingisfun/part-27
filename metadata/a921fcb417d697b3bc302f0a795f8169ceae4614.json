Montgomery Gentry contribute &quot;She Couldn't Change Me,&quot; which came in at #7 for the year of 2001. CMA Vocal group Lonestar add &quot;With Me&quot; which was a Top 10 song for the guys. The Dixie Chicks have &quot;Without You,&quot; which was a No. 1 song for them in 2000. And rounding out the Top 5 is Trick Pony with &quot;On a Night Like This.&quot; \n\nThis album is an eclectic mix of artists from Billy Gilman to Kenny Rogers to keith urban. Chances are, you may have some of these hits on their original albums, but most people won't have all of them. That is what makes this a great compilation. \n\nAll of the songs on the disc, with the exception of Dwight Yoakam's &quot;I Want You To Want Me&quot; ranked in the Top 20 or better on the charts, so you've most likely heard them. There are no disappointments here.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a921fcb417d697b3bc302f0a795f8169ceae4614","amp;dn":"Totally+Country++%5Bmp3%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5BLoC.+Blazer%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a921fcb417d697b3bc302f0a795f8169ceae4614","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,33,252,180,23,214,151,179,188,48,47,10,121,95,129,105,206,174,70,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
