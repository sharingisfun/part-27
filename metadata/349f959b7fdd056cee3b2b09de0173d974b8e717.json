Charley Pride's 3rd Album, &quot;The Country Way&quot; was the best album of his entire career! It could have been a Greatest Hits album - all of the songs are THAT good!! Charley is way over due for a boxed set on his entire RCA career, but - hopefully - that will happen soon. You cannot go wrong with this cd. In fact, buy 5 and give to your friends and neighbors. If there is a greater demand for these 60's country music super stars on cd, someone will put out more of all of the deserving artists.\r\n\r\nBeing a UK citizen and resident, it took me longer to receive this superb CD than the earlier reviewer, Chris. I fully endorse his review and would agree that 'The country way' is Charley's best ever album as every song is strong, and there were 12 tracks to an album then, to boot. I would also reiterate, supported by Chris, that Sony should hurry up and produce a 'Complete RCA albums' set by Charley. I said this a year ago when I reviewed Music City's earlier 2on1 of Charley's first two RCA albums. It is criminal that of the three dozen or so original RCA albums recorded by Charley that now, December 2014, there are I believe just 9 available on CD: four on the two 2on1s by Music City, the two gospel albums as a 2on1 on Real Gone Music, another 2on1 UK release on Morello [There's a little bit of Hank in me/Burgers and fries] plus Charley's Christmas album on Music City.\r\n\r\nRegarding this particular release all I will say is that the sound quality is top notch, as with the first MC 2on1 Jack Clement, who really knew how to bring the best out of Charley, wrote or co-wrote no less than seven of the songs, that it surprised me that neither of the two single hits on 'The country way' ['Does my ring hurt your finger' and 'The day the world stood still'] made the top spot as both are fabulous songs and, finally, these two albums include Charley's first takes on songs by Jerry Foster and Bill Rice, the aforesaid 'The day the world stood still' and Ben Peters 'Before the next teardrop falls' [co-written with Vivian Keith]. These guys could write, Charley could sing and Jack Clement and others could produce: this was and still is the tops in country music. Message to customers/readers: please buy and to Music City: don't make us wait another year for another twofer, chop chop, get on with it and issue more of this wonderful music.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe Country Way (1967)\r\n\r\n01.
