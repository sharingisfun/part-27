From bad science and oafish behavior to stomach-turning procedures that hurt more than helped, Strange Medicine presents strange but true facts and an honor roll of doctors, scientists, and dreamers who inadvertently turned the clock of medicine backward:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The ancient Egyptians applied electric eels to cure gout.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Medieval dentists burned candles in patientsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ mouths to kill invisible worms gnawing at their teeth.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Renaissance physicians timed surgical procedures according to the position of the stars, and instructed epileptics to collect fresh blood from the newly beheaded.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Dr. Walter Freeman, the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foremost practitioner of lobotomies, practiced his craft while traveling on family camping trips, cramming the back of the station wagon with kidsÃ¢â‚¬â€and surgical toolsÃ¢â‚¬â€then hammering ice picks into the eye sockets of his patients in between hikes in the woods.\n\nStrange Medicine is an illuminating panorama of medical history as youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never seen it before.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:951a17bb5e515d738793a411b96579da1616b605","amp;dn":"Strange+Medicine%3A+A+Shocking+History+of+Real+Medical+Practices+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"951a17bb5e515d738793a411b96579da1616b605","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,26,23,187,94,81,93,115,135,147,164,17,185,101,121,218,22,22,182,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
