Defying the traditional and idealized interpretation of the Florentine Villa, the author: analyses the economic factors that powered the investment in and building of country houses and estates from the early Renaissance times onwards, as well as the ideology and the architectural and literary models that promoted the Florentine villa; explores the area between Florence and Sesto in its history, morphology and representation; and, looks at the villas existing in the area. A contribution to the protection of the important cultural heritage of the landscape in the Florentine area and of its historic buildings, villas and gardens, this study makes engaging reading, not only for scholars and students in architecture, landscape design and social history, but also for the well informed reader interested in art, architecture and gardens.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cac121a8c2826ab27f19baed5ca861ce11e53614","amp;dn":"The+Florentine+Villa+-+Architecture+History+Society+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cac121a8c2826ab27f19baed5ca861ce11e53614","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,193,33,168,194,130,106,178,127,25,186,237,92,168,97,206,17,229,54,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
