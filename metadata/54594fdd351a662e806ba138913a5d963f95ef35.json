After achieving moderate local success with the 1983 release of their experimental hip hop 12&quot; Cooky Puss, they made the transition to hip hop in 1984 and a string of successful 12&quot; singles followed by their debut album Licensed to Ill in 1986 which received international critical acclaim and commercial success. As of 2010, they have sold 22 million albums in the United States and 40 million albums worldwide.\n\nThey are one of the longest lived hip hop acts worldwide and continue to enjoy commercial and critical success in 2011, nearly 25 years after the release of their debut album. On September 27, 2007, they were nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[2] In 2009, the group released digitally remastered deluxe editions of their albums Paul's Boutique, Check Your Head, Ill Communication and Hello Nasty. Their eighth studio album, Hot Sauce Committee Part Two, was released on May 3, 2011,[3] and received positive reviews. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sounds of Science 1999\n\n\nBeastie Boys Anthology: The Sounds of Science is the first Beastie Boys anthology composed of greatest hits, B-sides, and previously-unreleased tracks. The retail release comes with a trifold sleeve that displays the majority of the band's album covers and a booklet describing the origin behind most of the songs. The title of the anthology is from the song of the same name from their second album, Paul's Boutique.\n\nCustomers could also purchase a custom version of the album from Grand Royal featuring the B-sides and rarities that they wanted through mail order.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nDisc 1 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Beastie Boys&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Slow and Low&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Shake Your Rump&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Gratitude&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Skills to Pay the Bills&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Root Down&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Believe Me&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Sure Shot&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Body Movin'&quot; (Fatboy Slim Remix)\n10.\t&quot;Boomin' Granny&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Fight for Your Right&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;Country Mike's Theme&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;Pass the Mic&quot;  \n14.\t&quot;Something's Got to Give&quot;  \n15.\t&quot;Bodhisattva Vow&quot;  \n16.\t&quot;Sabrosa&quot;  \n17.\t&quot;Song for the Man&quot;  \n18.\t&quot;Soba Violence&quot;  \n19.\t&quot;Alive&quot;  \n20.\t&quot;Jimmy James&quot; (Original Version)\n21.\t&quot;Three MC's and One DJ&quot; (Live Video Version)\n\n\nDisc 2 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;The Biz vs. the Nuge&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Sabotage&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Shadrach&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Brass Monkey&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Time for Livin'&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Dub the Mic&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Benny and the Jets&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;The Negotiation Limerick File&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;I Want Some&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;She's on It&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Son of Neckbone&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;Get It Together&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;Twenty Questions&quot;  \n14.\t&quot;Remote Control&quot;  \n15.\t&quot;Railroad Blues&quot;  \n16.\t&quot;Live Wire&quot;  \n17.\t&quot;So What'cha Want&quot;  \n18.\t&quot;Netty's Girl&quot;  \n19.\t&quot;Egg Raid on Mojo&quot;  \n20.\t&quot;Hey Ladies&quot;  \n21.\t&quot;Intergalactic&quot;  \n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54594fdd351a662e806ba138913a5d963f95ef35","amp;dn":"Beastie+Boys+-+Sounds+of+Science+%28Best+Of%29+1999+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54594fdd351a662e806ba138913a5d963f95ef35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,89,79,221,53,26,102,46,128,107,161,56,145,58,93,150,63,149,239,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
