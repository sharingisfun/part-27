When a crew of sketchy vampires takes up residence in Dullsville's lonely graveyard, Alexander finds this motley bunch led by his very own blood-sucking cousin, Claude Sterling. Shocking! Claude and his creepy crew can only spell out more problems for the pair, especially when Raven finds them in daylight in the very last place she could ever imagine. What could Claude and his invaders be doingÃ¢â‚¬â€or searching forÃ¢â‚¬â€in Dullsville?\n\nThanks goes to AiAiAi for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41b8a6d1d9e05cac2fb3b0821df6e08862fc3f5c","amp;dn":"Vampire+Kisses%3A+Blood+Relatives+1+%282007%29+%5BTokyo+Pop%5D+%28Requested%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41b8a6d1d9e05cac2fb3b0821df6e08862fc3f5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,184,166,209,217,224,92,172,47,179,176,130,29,246,224,136,98,252,63,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
