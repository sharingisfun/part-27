This album contains the best elements we saw in their previous albums: pretty and melodic tunes with almost reggae-happy drum beats in some songs, with cleverly written lyrics with sugar and spice hidden meanings.\n\nSome of the better songs in this album would be the album titled song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHands All OverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, as well as others such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStutterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, which is guaranteed to get stuck in your head and have you singing along all day.\n\n[img]http://i896.photobucket.com/albums/ac169/pbf99/tr.gif[/img]\n\n   1.
