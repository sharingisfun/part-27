I picked this super-rare 7&quot; vinyl in a record store in Milan, Italy in 1989. Unidentified means that exact dates and sessions are unknown, but some tracks are listed as being recorded in July and September 1978. It's a great, humorous set with a fine interview bookmarking the tracks. This EP ran almost a third of a semitone too fast. That's also been corrected.\n\n\nLineage: MPL001 LP -&gt; sound Forge -&gt;-34.8 cents speed correction -&gt;Track split up -&gt;FLAC via TLH, level 6, sectors aligned and verified, FLAC integrity checked.\n\nEnjoy!\nA DoinkerTape&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetlist (Run time 17m 52s):\n\n01.
