An explicitly political band, their music crackled with raw energy on their first releases, but their sound broadened as the songwriting of guitarists/singers Mick Jones and Joe Strummer matured.\n\nA love of reggae (Junior Murvin's &quot;Police And Thieves&quot;, work with Mikey Dread) and classic 60's tunes (Bobby Fuller's &quot;I Fought The Law&quot;) gave them a depth that most of the punk movement lacked, and pushed them in directions both obscure (the dub songs on the &quot;Sandinista&quot; set) and popular (&quot;Rock The Casbah&quot;, a top 10 hit).\nEntertainment Reviews:\n\nEntertainment Weekly\n&quot;...tear-down-the-walls punk....the Clash's most protean tracks make current alternative rock sound diluted and compromised.&quot; - Rating: A-\n\nQ - 4/00, p.107\n5 stars out of 5 - &quot;...a 63-track telling of one of rock's more labyrinthine yarns....we travel from a 1977 demo of 'Janie Jones' to the unedited version of 'Straight To Hell'....about as good as record consumption gets.&quot;\n\nMelody Maker - 2/29/00, pp.48-9\n5 stars out of 5 - &quot;...represents the finest body of work a British band has left since The Beatles....concentrating heavily on their finest 2 albums [THE CLASH and LONDON CALLING]....Perfect.&quot;\n\n\n\nTracks of Disc 1:\n\n    * 1.Janie Jones (Demo)\n    * 2.Career Opportunities (Demo)\n    * 3.White Riot\n    * 4.1977\n    * 5.I'm So Bored With The U.S.A.\n    * 6.Hate &amp; War\n    * 7.What's My Name\n    * 8.Deny\n    * 9.London's Burning\n    * 10.Protex Blue\n    * 11.Police &amp; Thieves\n    * 12.48 Hours\n    * 13.Cheat\n    * 14.Garageland\n    * 15.Capital Radio One\n    * 16.Complete Control\n    * 17.Clash City Rockers\n    * 18.City Of The Dead\n    * 19.Jail Guitar Doors\n    * 20.The Prisoner\n    * 21.(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais\n    * 22.Pressure Drop\n    * 23.1-2 Crush On You\n    * 24.English Civil War (Live)\n    * 25.I Fought The Law (Live)\n\n\t\nTracks of Disc 2:\n\n    * 1.Safe European Home\n    * 2.Tommy Gun\n    * 3.Julie's Been Working For The Drug Squad\n    * 4.Stay Free\n    * 5.One Emotion (Previously Unreleased)\n    * 6.Groovy Times\n    * 7.Gates Of The West\n    * 8.Armagideon Time\n    * 9.London Calling\n    * 10.Brand New Cadillac\n    * 11.Rudie Can't Fail\n    * 12.The Guns Of Brixton\n    * 13.Spanish Bombs\n    * 14.Lost In The Supermarket\n    * 15.The Right Profile\n    * 16.The Card Cheat\n    * 17.Death Or Glory\n    * 18.Clampdown\n    * 19.Train In Vain\n    * 20.Bankrobber\n\nTracks of Disc 3:\n\n    * 1.Police On My Back\n    * 2.The Magnificent Seven\n    * 3.The Leader\n    * 4.The Call Up\n    * 5.Somebody Got Murdered\n    * 6.Washington Bullets\n    * 7.Broadway\n    * 8.Lightning Strikes (Not Once But Twice) (Live)\n    * 9.Every Little Bit Hurts (Previously Unreleased)\n    * 10.Stop The World\n    * 11.Midnight To Stevens (Previously Unreleased)\n    * 12.This Is Radio Clash\n    * 13.Cool Confusion\n    * 14.Red Angel Dragnet (Edited Version)\n    * 15.Ghetto Defendant (Edited Version)\n    * 16.Rock The Casbah\n    * 17.Should I Stay Or Should I Go\n    * 18.Straight To Hell (Unedited Version)\n    * 19.Bonus Track 1\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:283c6d800b17be75ba11cf2997be9fcc4b430c1e","amp;dn":"Clash+On+Broadway+3+CD+Box+Set","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"283c6d800b17be75ba11cf2997be9fcc4b430c1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,60,109,128,11,23,190,117,186,17,207,41,151,190,159,204,75,67,12,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
