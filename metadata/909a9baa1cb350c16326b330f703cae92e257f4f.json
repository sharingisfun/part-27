Graduating from the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology in 2006, Adele was given a recording contract by XL Recordings after a friend posted her demo on Myspace the same year. In 2007, she received the Brit Awards &quot;Critics' Choice&quot; award and won the BBC Sound of 2008. Her debut album, 19, was released in 2008 to commercial and critical success. It is certified four times platinum in the UK, and double platinum in the US. An appearance she made on Saturday Night Live in late 2008 boosted her career in the US. At the 51st Annual Grammy Awards in 2009, Adele received the awards for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.\r\n25 is her third studio album .  Following the release and international success of Adele's second studio album 21 (2011), she had planned to quit the music industry and go out on a positive note. However, Adele decided to take a hiatus instead and raise her son. During her sabbatical, she suffered with writer's block and rescheduled the album's studio sessions fearing she had lost her ability to write songs. In 2013, Adele had a breakthrough and the material that eventually became 25 manifested, with writing and recording continuing through to 2015. According to the singer, the album's title is a reflection of her when she was 25 and the frame of mind she was in during that age.\r\n\r\nThe lead single, &quot;Hello&quot;, was a critical and commercial success, topping the charts in 26 countries including the United Kingdom and the United States, where &quot;Hello&quot; became the first single to sell one-million downloads in a release week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArtists:................-Adele \r\nAlbum Name:.............-25 \r\nQuality:................-FLAC (tracks)\r\nSize:...................-287MB\r\nSize:...................-111MB\r\nTracks:.................-11\r\nGenre:..................-Pop / Soul\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n01.
