It is one of my favorite films simply because it is unpretentious.  The characters are interesting and they show both male and female characters well.  It has original hard subtitles in English.\n\n   I've made the new torrent because it's availability is inconsistent in this format.\n\nNotes written January 26th 2013\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e73db2c507ffa6182e01a5f5176702be70e56646","amp;dn":"Secret+Ballot+%282001%29+directed+by+Babak+Payami+Farsi+with+ENG+har","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e73db2c507ffa6182e01a5f5176702be70e56646","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,61,178,197,7,255,166,24,46,1,165,245,23,103,2,190,112,229,102,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
