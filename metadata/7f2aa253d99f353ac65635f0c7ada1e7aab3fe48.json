Then with Dirty Harry came super-stardom. But even that was not enough. Hiss goal was to get behind the camera - to make great films. To achieve this end, he has produced, directed and starred in such classics as Play Misty for Me, High Plains Drifter, The Outlaw Josie Wales, Bronco Billy, Honkytonk Man, Pale Rider, Heartbreak Ridge, White Hunter, Black Heart, and Unforgiven. Meanwhile, Clint continues to explore, to take risks - always seeking to redefine his image as the loner who, when the chips are down, cares. Including clips from his best pictures, here is his life as told by Clint himself. Included are recollections of Gene Hackman, Marsha Mason, Michael Cimino, Forest Whitaker, Genevieve Bujold, Frances Fisher, Jessica Walter and others.\n\nDirected by : Gene Feldman\n\nA Wombat Production (1993)\n\n\nReviews :\n\n&quot;An insightful and engrossing portrait. . .
