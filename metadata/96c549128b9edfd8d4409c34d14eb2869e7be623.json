It was intended to be released before Pinkerton, but never was.\n\nThis is a rock opera created by Rivers Cuomo of Weezer that tells the story of Jonas and his love for Maria. Also in the story are his 2 fellow cadets named Juan and Dondo.\n\nI realize that this is not the original track list. in fact there are 2 track lists created by Rivers. What i did was meld the 2 together to create a proper story. (You might note that i removed 'Lisa' from the list because that song is not directed towards Maria like the rest of the album.\n\nThis is my first torrent. Enjoy!\n:]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96c549128b9edfd8d4409c34d14eb2869e7be623","amp;dn":"Songs+from+the+Black+Hole","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96c549128b9edfd8d4409c34d14eb2869e7be623","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,197,73,18,139,158,223,216,212,64,156,52,209,78,178,134,158,123,230,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
