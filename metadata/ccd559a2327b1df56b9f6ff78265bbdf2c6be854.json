The area had been subject to bombs and artillery, and Duncan found a severely damaged kennel which had once supplied the German Army with German Shepherd dogs. The only dogs left alive in the kennel were a starving mother with a litter of five nursing puppies, their eyes still shut because they were less than a week old. Duncan rescued the dogs and brought them back to his unit. When the puppies were weaned he gave the mother to an officer and three of the litter to other soldiers, but he kept a male and a female. He felt that these two dogs were symbols of his good luck. He called them Rin Tin Tin and Nanette after a pair of good luck charms called Rintintin and NÃƒÂ©nette that French children often gave to the American soldiers. Duncan sensed that Nanette was the smarter of the two puppies.(The soldiers were usually told that Rintintin and NÃƒÂ©nette were lucky lovers who had survived a bombing attack, but the original dolls had been designed by Francisque Poulbot before the war in late 1913 to look like Paris street urchins. Contrary to popular usage, Poulbot said that Rintintin was the girl doll.\n\nIn July 1919, Duncan managed to bundle the dogs aboard a ship taking him back to the US at the end of the war. When he got to Long Island, New York, for re-entry processing, he put his dogs in the care of a Hempstead breeder named Mrs. Leo Wanner who raised police dogs. Nanette was diagnosed with pneumonia; as a replacement the breeder gave Duncan another female German Shepherd puppy. Duncan headed to California by rail with his dogs. While Duncan was traveling by train, Nanette died in Hempstead. As a memorial, Duncan named his new puppy Nanette II, but he called her Nanette. Duncan, Rin Tin Tin and Nanette II settled at his home in Los Angeles. Rin Tin Tin was a dark sable color and had very dark eyes. Nanette II was much lighter in color.\n\nAn athletic silent film actor named Eugene Pallette was one of Duncan's friends. The two men enjoyed the outdoors; they took the dogs to the Sierras where Pallette liked to hunt while Duncan taught Rin Tin Tin various tricks. Duncan thought that his dog might win a few awards at dog shows and thus be a valuable source of puppy sales, bred with Nanette. In 1922 Duncan was a founding member of the Shepherd Dog Club of California, based in Los Angeles. At the club's first show Rin Tin Tin showed his agility but also demonstrated an aggressive temper, growling, barking and snapping. It was a very poor performance, but the worst moment came afterward when Duncan was walking home. A heavy bundle of newspapers was thrown off of a delivery truck and it landed on the dog, breaking his left front leg. Duncan had the injured limb set in plaster and he nursed the dog back to health for nine months.\n\nTen months after the break, the leg was healed and Rin Tin Tin was entered in a show for German Shepherds in Los Angeles. Rin Tin Tin had learned to leap great heights. At the dog show while making a winning leap of 11 feet 9 inches (3.58 m) he was filmed by Duncan's acquaintance Charley Jones, who had just developed a slow-motion camera. Seeing his dog being filmed, Duncan became convinced Rin Tin Tin could become the next Strongheart, a successful film dog that lived in his own full-sized stucco bungalow with its own street address in the Hollywood Hills, separate from the mansion of his owners who lived a block away next to Roy Rogers. Duncan later wrote, &quot;I was so excited over the motion-picture idea that I found myself thinking of it night and day.&quot;\n\nSYNOPSIS:- Rin Tin Tin - THe Lightning Warrior (1931)\nThe Wolfman, a mysterious masked figure, is leading an Indian uprising to drive local settlers off their land. \nThe Wolfman kills Jimmy Carter's father and Alan Scott's brother, which leads the two heroes and Alan's dog Rinty, to hunt down and defeat the villain.\n\nA Rin-Tin-Tin serial presented in 12 episodes.
