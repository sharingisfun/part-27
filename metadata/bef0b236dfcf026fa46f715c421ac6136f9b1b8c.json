A new book by a prominent scientist says that something \n(like the universe) can come from nothing based on certain universal physical laws. \nBut where did those laws come from? The truth is that science canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t prove how the universe began. \nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nonsense to suggest that it can.\n\n\nPrager 20120327  2 Rush to Judgment\n\nPrager H2 The Trayvon Martin case gets more complex as new information emerges. Still, we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what happened\n at the scene, so everyone should restrain from making judgments. The media and Ã¢â‚¬Å“black leadersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ like Al Sharpton and\n Jesse Jackson havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t got the messageÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ The second day of the Supreme CourtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ObamaCare hearings dealt with the core\n issue Ã¢â‚¬â€œ are there limits to the governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s power?\n\n\nPrager 20120327  1 Teens and Adults\n\nPrager H1 When do teens spend time with adults? Is it more or less time than the past? If itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s less \n(as Dennis believes) what are the consequences? A Best of Prager Hour. Originally broadcast on February 16, 2012.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bef0b236dfcf026fa46f715c421ac6136f9b1b8c","amp;dn":"The+Dennis+Prager+Radio+Show++MAR-27-2012+TUES+CF+MP3+64K","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bef0b236dfcf026fa46f715c421ac6136f9b1b8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,240,178,54,223,207,2,111,164,111,113,92,66,26,198,19,111,155,27,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
