One that can outrun dogs, hit a home run off the best pitcher in the neighborhood, tie a knot no one can undo. &quot;Kid's gotta be a maniac,&quot; is what the folks in Two Mills say. It's also the story of how this boy, Jeffrey Lionel &quot;Maniac&quot; Magee, confronts racism in a small town, tries to find a home where there is none and attempts to soothe tensions between rival factions on the tough side of town. Presented as a folk tale, it's the stuff of storytelling. &quot;The history of a kid,&quot; says Jerry Spinelli, &quot;is one part fact, two parts legend, and three parts snowball.&quot; And for this kid, four parts of fun. Maniac Magee won the 1991 Newbery Medal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21c601f82d20c301b495c26b8af79db131d08a08","amp;dn":"Maniac+Magee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21c601f82d20c301b495c26b8af79db131d08a08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,198,1,248,45,32,195,1,180,149,194,107,138,247,157,177,49,208,138,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
