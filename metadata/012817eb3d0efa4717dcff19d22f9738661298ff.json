Even Heavy Metal fans often like and/or hold much respect for \nJohnny's life's work. Johnny spent much of his life on &quot;both sides of the track&quot; and some \nof his best music never came out until after 2000! \nJohnny Died only a few years ago, but not before recording his own version of The Nine Inch \nNail's song: &quot;HURT&quot;. Johnny then &quot;owned&quot; HURT, as he inserted his own meaning behind a song \nabout drug abuse and made it come off as his final hit/video which explained his pain and \nthoughts of living the short few days until both his wife June Carter, and next Johnny BOTH \nsoon died. To this day many can not listen to HURT because Johnny did such a master-job of \nexpressing his pain and agony of dying. Yet once again Johnny proved to us how he was \ncapable of writing his own songs, OR recording other artists's songs and come off with many \nfans believing Johnny actually wrote so re-recorded songs sometimes written by others.\nBut Johnny's REAL talent was found with his ability to write his own great hits which often \nwent high up the music charts.\nAlthough Johnny often showed his rough and rowdy side as he did in this free concert for \nprisoners (there is some mild swearing in it), Cash was truly a Christian at heart who \nattended Church often, especially in the decades prior to his death. Thats part of what \nmade Johnny special, he could get along with criminals fine and yet still keep his faith in \nGod and go to church many Sundays. It seemed everyone enjoyed his music and he got along \nfine with almost everyone.\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nPersonal Thoughts About This CD:\n\nMany of us were not yet born in 1968, but the music on this recording is timeless. This \nrecording is known as one of the single best performances that Johnny ever did. Johnny \nmarried June Carter a few weeks after this record was made. He is on top of his game in \nthis recording and it shows how easily he could get along with any crowd. Also it contains \nthe best version of Folsom Prison Blues ever recorded, as the live single tore the country \ncharts up in 1968 and was played all over the world (as my sources advise me).\nI firmly believe Live at Folsom Prison is one of Johnny's Best Recordings he ever made. Be \nadvised the recording does contain a few mild swear words in it, but nothing too strong for \nthe kiddies- imho.\nIf you enjoy this recording stay tuned for more recent recordings from Johnny that never \ngot the airplay they truly deserved (post 2000) in the near future.\nPersonal Thoughts Over. ;)\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEdited from source located at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_Folsom_Prison\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAt Folsom Prison is a live album by Johnny Cash, released on Columbia Records in May 1968. \nSince his 1955 song &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot;, Cash had been interested in performing at a \nprison. His idea was put on hold until 1967, when personnel changes at Columbia Records put \nBob Johnston in charge of producing Cash's material. Cash had recently controlled his drug \nabuse problems, and was looking to turn his career around after several years of limited \ncommercial success. Backed with June Carter, whom he married later that year; Carl Perkins \nand the Tennessee Three, Cash performed two shows at Folsom State Prison in California on \nJanuary 13, 1968. The resulting album consisted of 15 tracks from the first show and two \ntracks from the second.\nDespite little initial investment by Columbia, the album was a hit in the United States, \nreaching number one on the country charts and the top 15 of the national album chart. The \nlead single from the album, a live version of &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot;, was a top 40 hit, \nCash's first since 1964's &quot;Understand Your Man&quot;. At Folsom Prison received good reviews \nupon its release and the ensuing popularity revitalized Cash's career, leading to the \nrelease of a second prison album, At San Quentin. The album was re-released with additional \ntracks in 1999 and as a three-disc set in 2008.\nBackground\nCash first took interest in Folsom State Prison while serving in the U.S. Air Force \nSecurity Service. In 1953, his unit watched Crane Wilbur's film Inside the Walls of Folsom \nPrison. The movie inspired Cash to write a song that reflected his perception of prison \nlife.[1] The result was &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot;, Cash's second single on Sun Records. After \nits release, the song became popular among inmates, who would sometimes write to Cash, \nrequesting him to perform at their prisons.[2] Cash first answered one of the letters by \nperforming at Huntsville State Prison in 1957.[3] Satisfied by the favorable reception of \nthe concert, he performed at several other prisons, including Folsom in 1966.\nA few years after attaining commercial success from songs such as &quot;I Walk the Line&quot;, \n&quot;Understand Your Man&quot;, and &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;, Cash's popularity waned. This was due in no \nsmall part to his increasing dependence on drugs.[4] In 1967, Cash sought help for his \nescalating drug problems; by the end of the year, his drug use decreased and he sought to \nturn his career around.[5] Concurrently, the country portion of Columbia Records underwent \nmajor personnel changes. Frank Jones and Don Law, who had produced several of Cash's \nalbums, were ousted in favor of Bob Johnston, who was known for his erratic behavior and \nwillingness to disagree with studio executives.[6] Cash saw this as an opportunity to pitch \nhis idea of recording a live album at a prison; Johnston enthusiastically supported the \nconcept.[7] Johnston called San Quentin State Prison and Folsom, and Folsom was the first \nto respond.[8]\n\nRecording\n\nPhoto of walls and guard towers of a prison.\nThe album was recorded at Folsom State Prison in Folsom, California.\nOn January 10, 1968, Cash and June Carter checked into the El Rancho Motel in Sacramento, \nCalifornia. They were later accompanied by the Tennessee Three, Carl Perkins, The Statler \nBrothers, Johnny's father Ray Cash and producer Johnston. The performers rehearsed for two \ndays, an uncommon occurrence for them. sometimes with two or more songs being rehearsed \nconcurrently by various combinations of the musicians.[9]. A fashion show taking place in \nan adjacent ballroom provided an unneeded distraction, and during the rehearsal sessions on \nJanuary 12, California governor Ronald Reagan, who was at the hotel for an after-dinner \nspeech, visited the band and offered his encouragement.[10] One of the foci of the sessions \nwas to learn &quot;Greystone Chapel&quot;, a song written by inmate Glen Sherley. Sherley recorded a \nversion of the song, which he passed on to Rev. Floyd Gressett, a Ventura, CA pastor who \nregularly visited inmates at Folsom, via the prison's recreation director.[11][12] On \nJanuary 13, the group traveled to Folsom, meeting up with Los Angeles Times writer Robert \nHilburn and Columbia photographer Jim Marshall, who were paid to document the album for the \nliner notes.[13]\nCash decided to hold two performances on January 13, one at 9:40 AM and one at 12:40 PM, in \ncase the first performance was unsatisfactory.[14] After an introduction by MC Hugh Cherry, \nwho encouraged the prisoners to &quot;respond&quot; to Cash's performance, Carl Perkins took the \nstage.[15] Perkins performed his hit song &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;. Following this song, The \nStatler Brothers sang their hit &quot;Flowers on the Wall&quot; and the country standard &quot;This Old \nHouse&quot;.[16] Cherry again took the stage and instructed the inmates not to cheer for Cash \nuntil he introduced himself; they obliged.[2] Cash opened both shows with a rendition of \n&quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot; and the concerts contained many songs about prison, including &quot;The \nWall&quot;, &quot;Green, Green Grass of Home&quot;, and the gallows humor tune &quot;25 Minutes to Go&quot;. The \nsinger also included other songs of despair, such as the Merle Travis song &quot;Dark as a \nDungeon&quot;. Following &quot;Orange Blossom Special&quot;, Cash included a few &quot;slow, ballad-type \nsongs&quot;, including &quot;Send a Picture of Mother&quot; and &quot;The Long Black Veil&quot;, and then followed \nwith three novelty songs from his album Everybody Loves A Nut, &quot;Dirty Old Egg-Sucking Dog&quot;, \n&quot;Flushed from the Bathroom of Your Heart&quot;, and &quot;Joe Bean&quot;.[17] June Carter joined Cash on \nstage to perform a pair of duets. After a seven-minute version of a song from his &quot;Blood, \nSweat and Tears&quot; album, &quot;The Legend of John Henry's Hammer&quot;, Cash took a break and Carter \nrecited a poem.[17] Cash ended both concerts with Sherley's &quot;Greystone Chapel&quot;. The second \nconcert was not as fruitful as the first; the musicians were fatigued from the earlier \nshow.[18] Only two songs from the second concert, &quot;Give My Love to Rose&quot; and &quot;I Got \nStripes,&quot; made it onto the LP release.\n\n\nReception and impact\n\nThe album release of At Folsom Prison was prepared in four months. Despite the recent \nsuccess of &quot;Rosanna's Going Wild&quot;, a Cash single released just prior to the Folsom concerts \nthat reached number two on the country charts, Columbia initially invested little into the \nalbum or its single &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot;. This was due partially to Columbia's efforts to \npromote pop stars instead of country artists.[19][20] Nevertheless, the single charted on \nthe Billboard Hot 100 on May 25, 1968; it also hit the country charts a week later.[21][22] \nThe single suffered a setback, however, when Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated on June 5, \n1968. Radio stations ceased playing the single due to the macabre line: &quot;I shot a man in \nReno/Just to watch him die&quot;. Reeling in the success prior to the assassination, Columbia \ndemanded that Johnston remix the single with the line removed. Despite protest from Cash, \nthe single was edited and re-released. The new version became a success, hitting number one \non the country charts and the top forty on the national charts.[23] The successful single \nprompted the album to climb the album charts, eventually reaching number one on the Top \nCountry Albums chart and number thirteen on the Pop Albums chartGGÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼GÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¥the forerunner to \nthe Billboard 200.[24] By August 1968, Folsom had shipped over 300,000 copies; two months \nlater it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for \nshipping over 500,000.[25][26]\nAt Folsom Prison received rave reviews upon its release. Al Aronowitz of Life stated that \nCash sang the songs like &quot;someone who has grown up believing he is one of the people that \nthese songs are about.&quot;[27] For The Village Voice, Ann Fisher wrote that &quot;every cut is \nspecial in its own way&quot; and Richard Goldstein noted that the album was &quot;filled with the \nkind of emotionalism you seldom find in rock.&quot;[28][29] Fredrick E. Danker of Sing Out! \npraised At Folsom Prison as &quot;an album structured an aural experience for us.&quot;[30]\nThe success of At Folsom Prison revitalized Cash's career; according to Cash, &quot;that's where \nthings really got started for me again&quot;.[4] Sun Records re-dubbed Cash's previous B-side \n&quot;Get Rhythm&quot; with applause similar to Folsom's, and it became successful enough to enter \nthe Hot 100.[31] Cash returned to the prison scene in 1969 when he recorded At San Quentin \nat San Quentin State Prison. At San Quentin became Cash's first album to hit number one on \nthe Pop chart and produced the number two hit &quot;A Boy Named Sue&quot;. The ensuing popularity \nfrom the Folsom concert also prompted ABC to give Cash his own television show.[32]\nThe album was re-released on October 19, 1999 with three extra tracks excluded from the \noriginal LP: &quot;Busted&quot;, &quot;Joe Bean&quot;, and &quot;The Legend of John Henry's Hammer&quot;. Stephen Thomas \nErlewine of Allmusic praised the new version, calling it &quot;the ideal blend of mythmaking and \ngritty reality.&quot;[33] On May 27, 2003, At Folsom Prison was certified triple platinum by the \nRIAA for shipping over three million units.[26] Since its release, it has been acknowledged \nas one of the greatest albums of all time by several sources. In 2003, the album was ranked \nnumber 88 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Also that year, \nit was one of 50 recordings chosen by the Library of Congress to be added to the National \nRecording Registry.[34] Country Music Television named it the third greatest album in \ncountry music in 2006.[35] Blender listed the album as the 63rd greatest American album of \nall time and as one of the &quot;500 CDs You Must Own&quot;.[36][37] In 2006, Time listed it among \nthe 100 greatest albums of all time.[38]\n\n\nIn 2008, Columbia and Legacy Records re-issued At Folsom Prison as a two CD, one DVD set.\n \nThis so-called &quot;Legacy Edition&quot; contained both concerts uncut and remastered. The included \nDVD, produced by Bestor Cram and Michael Streissguth of Northern Light Productions, \nfeatured pictures and interviews relevant to the concert. Pitchfork Media lauded the \ncollection, claiming that it had &quot;the force of empathic endeavors, as if he were doing \npenance for his notorious bad habits.&quot;[39] Christian Hoard wrote for Rolling Stone that the \nLegacy edition &quot;makes for an excellent historical document, highlighting Cash's rapport \nwith prison folk.&quot;[40]\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n\nOriginal release (1968) Vinyl Record:\n\n    Side 1\n\n       1 &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot; (Cash)\n       2 &quot;Dark as a Dungeon&quot; (Merle Travis)\n       3 &quot;I Still Miss Someone&quot; (Johnny Cash, Roy Cash)\n       4 &quot;Cocaine Blues&quot; (T.
