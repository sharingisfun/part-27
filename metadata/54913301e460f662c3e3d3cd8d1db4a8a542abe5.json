The good-looking one is one-hundred-year-old ex-seminarian and roads scholar Travis OHearn. The green one is Catch, a demon with a nasty habit of eating most of the people he meets. Behind the fake Tudor faÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ade of Pine Cove, California, Catch sees a four-star buffet. Travis, on the other hand, thinks he sees a way of ridding himself of his toothy traveling companion. The winos, neo-pagans, and deadbeat Lotharios of Pine Cove, meanwhile, have other ideas. And none of them is quite prepared when all hell breaks loose.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54913301e460f662c3e3d3cd8d1db4a8a542abe5","amp;dn":"Christopher+Moore+-+Practical+Demon+Keeping+%28A+Comedy+of+Horrors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54913301e460f662c3e3d3cd8d1db4a8a542abe5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,145,51,1,228,96,246,98,195,227,211,205,141,29,180,168,165,66,171,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
