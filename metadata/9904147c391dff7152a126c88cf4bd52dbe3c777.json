In each place, they face challenges for which they need to combine their own talents with local techniques to outwit the environment they find themselves in. The series explores the incredible world of fishing, looking at its variety of fish and their behaviour in distinct environments, and revealing surprising animals and stunning landscapes.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Iceland \r\nEight anglers embark on their first expedition to the wilderness of Iceland, where they brave extreme cold, wind and rain to fish in some of the most challenging conditions they have ever faced. In the North West, close to the Arctic Circle, the angler's fish from sea kayaks in the freezing fjord before learning to harvest cod using a traditional Icelandic technique. Further south, in a lake heated by volcanic vents, they fly-fish for some of the largest brown trout in the world. Matt Hayes is joined by local fishing expert Vala - she will help him judge which angler must leave the expedition whilst the rest journey on to the next location in their global expedition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cc/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0b/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/06/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f0/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b6/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6a/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/37/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b7/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b9/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/67/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9b/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c5/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/19/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/85/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/17/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/09/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CALVC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3001 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.30 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\nPart 5 has no Merged Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02d9xfp","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9904147c391dff7152a126c88cf4bd52dbe3c777","amp;dn":"BBC+Earths+Wildest+Waters+The+Big+Fish+Series+1+1of6+Iceland+720","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9904147c391dff7152a126c88cf4bd52dbe3c777","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,4,20,124,57,29,255,113,82,161,38,200,140,244,189,82,219,227,199,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
