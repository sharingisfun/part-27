Some of the artists are huge stars in Brazil. Others are little known. The title of this collection, Brasileiro, means simply &quot;Brazilian.&quot; It is a tribute to a people whose musical passion and creativity are unsurpassed. \nMusic is more than just entertainment in Brazil. It is the soundtrack to life, a constant ambiance of rhythm and melody that enriches and supports the people through good times and bad. Carnaval, the bustling bacchanal every February, is an eruption of musical activity, but throughout the year the rhythms of samba, bossa nova, MPB (musica popular brasileira), forro, pagode and countless other styles are constantly in the air. They flow from the stereos of taxis, rural boom boxes, the rusty speakers of beachside cantinas and live, impromptu jam sessions on street corners. Brasileiro captures this ambiance and brings it into your home. \n\n\nTracklist:\nSilvia Torres - Take SaravÃƒÂ¡ \nCelso Machado - Despedida \nNazarÃƒÂ© Pereira - ClarÃƒÂ£o de Lua \nJoÃƒÂ£o Bosco - VatapÃƒÂ¡ \nRosa Passos - Ãƒï¿½guas de MarÃƒÂ§o \nJorge Ben - O Namorado Da Viuva \nClara Nunes - Canto das TrÃƒÂªs RaÃƒÂ§as \nChico CÃƒÂ©sar - Mama Ãƒï¿½frica \nZeca Baleiro - Essas EmoÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes \nMartinho Da Vila - Visgo da Jaca \nBeth Carvalho - DanÃƒÂ§a de SolidÃƒÂ£o \nChico Buarque - Cantando Na TorÃƒÂ³ \nGeraldo Azevedo - BerekekÃƒÂ© \n\n\n\nThis is one of the many PutumayoÃ‚Â´s records I have in mind to upload, so please help keep seeding after you downloaded.\nEnjoy It!\nUlysses56\n\n\nFor more info: http://www.putumayo.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22f4611e13b278a428f68983587d1abc84638a09","amp;dn":"Putumayo+Presents-Brasileiro+By+Ulysses56","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22f4611e13b278a428f68983587d1abc84638a09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,244,97,30,19,178,120,164,40,246,137,131,88,125,26,188,132,99,138,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
