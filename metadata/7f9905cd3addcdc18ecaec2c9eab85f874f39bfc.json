After a multi-year rest following the late-2000s burst of Everybody and Car Alarm, the quartet returned to the studio again to produce a mini-LP, 2011's The Moonlight Butterfly, and then its full-album companion, 2012's Runner. Extending the aims and themes of the group's late renaissance, Runner is less a guitar album and more an electronics album, with songs that rest on fewer chord changes and more synth wash.
