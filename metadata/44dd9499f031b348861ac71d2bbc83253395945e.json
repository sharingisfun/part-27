On his first day he is partnered up with John Estes, called Sleepy by his friends and Mad Bull by his enemies, a cop who stops crime with his own violent brand of justice. Mad Bull makes no qualms about executing common thieves with shotgun blasts if they even pose a minor threat. Mad Bull often steals from prostitutes and does incredible amounts of property damage while fighting crime. Mad Bull's unpoliceman-like behavior often puts him in hot water with his partner Daizaburo and the 34th precinct. However, despite how reckless or illegal these acts are, a good cause is always revealed (for example, Sleepy uses the money he steals from the prostitutes to fund a venereal disease clinic and a home for battered and raped women). Perrine Valley, a police lieutenant, joins Daizaburo and Sleepy later on to help them tackle more difficult cases involving the mafia and drug-running.\n\nNotes:\nThe anime adaptation was composed of four, 50-minute OVAs released in 1991. It selected four different stories from the Mad Bull 34 manga and maintained its high level of violence.\n\nThe OVA has also been released and dubbed for American audiences by Manga Entertainment, however, they have only been released on VHS. Keith Burgess, the head of Manga Entertainment, said several years ago that he intends to release the entire series on DVD. However, in 2006, Manga announced that they had lost the license to the series, making any sort of official DVD release impossible. The series has not been re-licensed by any other American company.\n\nAll files in .avi Format  \n\nuse \ncccp codec pack \nwww.cccp-project.net\n\nor \n\nklite codec pack\nwww.free-codecs.com/download/K_lite_codec_pack.htm\n\nMedia players that work well are: Media Player Clasic, VLC, KMPlayer.\n\nPlease leave comments helpful to others and seed once finished :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44dd9499f031b348861ac71d2bbc83253395945e","amp;dn":"Mad+Bull+34+OVA+1-4+Complete+%28Dubbed+in+English%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44dd9499f031b348861ac71d2bbc83253395945e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,221,148,153,240,49,179,72,134,26,199,29,43,188,131,37,51,149,148,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
