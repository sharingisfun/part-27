Before reading this guide, please watch Zeitgeist and Zeitgeist Addendum (go to my other torrent, Zeitgeist 2009 Pack to download these) for a better understanding of the topics discussed. Also, please watch these videos and read this guide with an open-mind, leave behind your current beliefs and opinions on our economic, political and social systems. \n\nI have released a new torrent which includes Zeitgeist and Zeitgeist Addendum with several subtitle files, the Activist Orientation Guide and the DVD slide-presentation of the guide featuring Peter Joseph, as well as Jacque Fresco and Roxanne Meadows' Venus Project booklet and video.

The more that are aware of this movement, the better it'll be. None of these files are meant for profit, either by myself or Peter Joseph.
