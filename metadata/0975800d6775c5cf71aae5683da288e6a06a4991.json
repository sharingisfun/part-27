The first two issues were in color, while the third one had black and white interiors (a not-uncommon occurrence with Eclipse, who used this tactic to keep low-selling books alive a bit longer -- see the later issues of 'Crossfire' as an example).\n\nAll three issues are found within. Props to the creative team and the scanners! Obtain it, bestow it!\n\n***PERSONAL NOTE***\n\nJesus *^#@!)&amp;' Christ, the ECUP is taking up a lot of time!!\n\nTherefore, in order to speed things up a bit AND to ease my burden, most of the remaining torrent descriptions will also contain a link to a fine Eclipse series that has ALREADY been uploaded by someone else but might be a little dated and/or under-seeded. After pointing you to said series, I will then seed it for (at least) 24 hours so that all of Santa's good little boys/girls/transgenders can nab the download. Once you have it, please PLEASE continue to seed it for a few days, just as you have been doing with my new uploads. Comprende vous?\n\nAlrighty then. 'World of Wood', a five-issue mini that collected work by Wally Wood, is our first entry. It was uploaded by fudoh101 a few months back and you can find it here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8644334/Wallace_Wood__World_of_Wood_(Eclipse)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8644334/Wallace_Wood__World_of_Wood_(Eclipse)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGet dat sumbitch, share dat sumbitch!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0975800d6775c5cf71aae5683da288e6a06a4991","amp;dn":"Hand+of+Fate+%28Eclipse%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0975800d6775c5cf71aae5683da288e6a06a4991","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,117,128,13,103,117,197,207,113,170,229,104,61,162,136,230,160,106,73,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
