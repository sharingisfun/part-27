The vast amount of footage they shot was edited into twelve films of varying lengths. Focusing on ordinary people spread over a wide geographic area-many of whom were living and working in collectives-the filmmakers recorded a unique moment in history, and also captured some of the more enduring aspects of Chinese culture.\n\nReleased for the first time on DVD, fully restored! You can either download the discs individually, or all together. The Ivens intended this to be one film.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca60f2b61d7bc567c8aad98e3686654ce86d8157","amp;dn":"Comment+Yukong+d%26eacute%3Bpla%26ccedil%3Ba+les+montagnes+%281976%29+AKA+Ho","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca60f2b61d7bc567c8aad98e3686654ce86d8157","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,96,242,182,29,123,197,103,200,170,217,142,54,134,101,76,232,109,129,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
