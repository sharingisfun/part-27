Then, mix in a tune that is about everything. Is it possible for\nthese two types of songs to be combined into one hit? Now, get prepared to turn\nit up Super Loud!\n\nSinger/songwriter Mark McKinney answers the aforementioned question with his\ninaugural CD, Get It On. Impressively, his first solo effort has numerous songs\nthat are about just that - life. After all, everything + nothing = everyday\nlife. Throughout the 13-song disc, the Big Spring, Texas, native mixes his\ncountry-rock voice with lyrics which you can easily relate to.\n\nIn addition to his powerful singing, the enthusiastic entertainer penned all 13\ntracks. Furthermore, McKinney also plays a mean acoustic guitar and harmonica on\nthe CD.\n\nMcKinney's debut single, &quot;Comfortable In This Skin,&quot; has been prowling about the\nTexas Music Charts. Though his first single release is definitely a chart-worthy\nhit, this Super Loud Music production is far from a one-hit wonder disc. For\nExample, McKinney exhibits his soft side in the love-interpreted tunes &quot;Fall,&quot;\n&quot;Addicted,&quot; and &quot;Are We Doing This.&quot; In addition, he proudly pipes songs about\nthe regular manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life in his first single, &quot;Stomping Ground,&quot; and &quot;Story of My\nLife.&quot; Also, he even mixes in a few songs about the pains that love can bring\nwith the powerful efforts of &quot;Bonfire,&quot; &quot;Reckless in Texas,&quot; and &quot;Deal Breaker.&quot;\n\nNow, turn it up more!\n\nPerhaps the best, not to mention most hilarious song on the disc is the popular\n&quot;The Myspace Song.&quot; McKinney playfully pokes fun at fictitious members of the\nsite's numerous guests. The song is completely in jest, and anyone who knows\nanything aboutwill get a laugh from the song - yes, even Tom. In\nfact, if not for his myspace site,this writer\nwould not have become such a huge McKinney fan.\n\nObviously, Get It On is jam packed with a powerful variety of vocals and music,\nboasting lyrics to match. Growing up a fan of country and some rock-and-roll\nmusic, it is not surprising that a touch of rock can be heard in many of this\ntalented performer's singles. His passionate voice blends both genres very well.\n\nChances are that after listening to the entire CD, you will start the disc over,\nand over, and over - I know I did. Granted, there are a few favorites on the\ndisc that stand out from the others. However, whereas most discs give a listener\ntwo to five &quot;good&quot; songs if the CD purchaser is lucky, Get It On should provide\ntremendous listening pleasure on at least ten of the tracks.\n\nNow, whatever you do, remember that Get It On is best enjoyed Super Loud.\n\nSo, turn it up, kick back, and let the good times roll.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1ee37ecbb2fa6ce5fb38769571e114f29df3560","amp;dn":"Mark_McKinney-Get_It_On-2007-XXS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1ee37ecbb2fa6ce5fb38769571e114f29df3560","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,238,55,236,187,47,166,206,95,179,135,105,87,30,17,79,41,223,53,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
