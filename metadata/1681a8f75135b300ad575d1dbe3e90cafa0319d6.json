Jazzie will tell you when talking about his early sound system days. And it is this determination, desire, resourcefulness, passion, enthusiasm, drive, ambition and a simple love for music that has got Soul II Soul where it is today. Jazzie took his first steps into the bass heavy world of the sound system when he was just 13. Following in their big brothers footsteps, Jazzie and a school friend known as Daddae started a sound called Jah Rico, which played mainly reggae music. After a three year apprenticeship as Jah Rico, Jazzie and Daddae changed the vibe of the sound and began playing more soulful music. Soul II Soul was created. We came up with the name Soul II Soul not just because of the music we played, but it also stood for Daddae and myself - two souls moving together. We?ve always had that kind of relationship ever since we were little. Hes a very integral part of what I do. There are not many words exchanged between us but everything that has happened very much in tandem.\n\n\n \n  01. [00:29] Fela Kuti &amp; Roy Ayers ~ Africa, Centre Of The World [Excerpt]\n  02.
