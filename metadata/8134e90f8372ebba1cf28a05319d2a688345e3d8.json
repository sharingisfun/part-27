Following a similar structure to Grand Theft Auto III, players are given the freedom to leave vehicles at any time to complete objectives on foot. Gameplay involves using weapons in violent encounters with criminals, performing deliveries, and engaging in high-speed chases and getaways in a variety of vehicles.\nThe adventure will take players across the sandy beaches of Miami, the winding cobblestone streets of Nice, and past the bazaars and drizzled rain of Istanbul as they infiltrate an international crime organization. U.K.-based developer Reflections, the team behind the first two titles in the Driver series as well as Stuntman, takes the wheel once again for the third game in the best-selling series.\n\nNOTE:\nCompressed with 7-zip (to shrink into the smallest size possible)\n7-Zip can be downloaded from here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.7-zip.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.7-zip.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy and Please help seed at least to 2.0","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8134e90f8372ebba1cf28a05319d2a688345e3d8","amp;dn":"Driv3r+%28PS2-NTSC%29+CivicScootin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8134e90f8372ebba1cf28a05319d2a688345e3d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,52,233,15,131,114,235,186,28,242,138,5,49,157,42,104,131,69,227,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
