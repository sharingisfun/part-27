I'm not sure why this is. I read a few things about mastering issues on the original recording but I'm not sure.\n\nThe untitled tracks are presumably from a greater collection as they are not listed on the original album art.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f86314cbddf01ec3c1b2adb7b9dd6484a207507","amp;dn":"Explorers+-+Expanded+Motion+ore+%5B1985%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f86314cbddf01ec3c1b2adb7b9dd6484a207507","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,134,49,76,189,223,1,236,60,27,42,219,123,157,214,72,74,32,117,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
