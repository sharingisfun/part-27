Gathered in     \n    the mansion are the most beautiful women: the army's special services    \n    could enroll for the pleasure of its returning heroes.Eric is            \n    stupefied to recognize Renata among the women, who are all ready and     \n    willing to make love with any officer present. Not many years ago,       \n    while still students, Renata and Eric had been very much in love.        \n    After making love in a room put at their disposal, Renata tells him      \n    that she had no choice but to accept joining the army as an official     \n    camp follower: her father's survival depended on it. The following       \n    morning, Renata leaves in a special women's convoy for Eastern front     \n    where they are scheduled to entertain hard-pressed officers and men.     \n    Will Eric and Renata's love survive those adventures?                    \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
