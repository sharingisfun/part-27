Because it's honestly redundant. Why have more than what you need unless you're a die hard fan. And if you're a die hard fan of a band, you wouldn't be torrenting their music. You would be supporting and buying, which I still support for every band album I upload. I promote torrenting, seeing if the band is good, then going out and buying the album. In no way do I promote the soul use of my torrents without intent to buy the album. Don't ruin the internet for us, these torrents are just a way to see how a band sounds, and find any missing tracks that you might not have.\n\nThank you and please seed. The support of my torrents, will greatly increase the amount of uploading I do. More seeds, more torrents, more smileys! :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d7678a9a055733bbeddf4add5659ecc5c03dc38","amp;dn":"BLOOD+ON+THE+DANCE+FLOOR+%28MOST+DISCOGRAPHY%29+%5BFUDGESOCIETY%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d7678a9a055733bbeddf4add5659ecc5c03dc38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,118,120,169,160,85,115,59,190,221,244,173,213,101,158,204,92,3,220,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
