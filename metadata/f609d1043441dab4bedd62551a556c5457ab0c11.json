Exclaim! magazine called the band &quot;one of the fiercest, ugliest, most threatening malcontents around&quot;. Decibel talked about the mix of styles on the album and weren't quite sure what to make of it (though they did give a positive review). Despite some minor criticisms, Sleepwell Deconstructor was well-received for a debut album released on a small label with less reach than other indies. The album was also rated as one of Decibel's top 40 releases of 2007. And I like them so theres that.
