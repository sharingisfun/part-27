Register at your Web site? Trust the information you provide? Neuro Web Design applies the research on motivation, decision making, and neuroscience to the design of Web sites. You will learn the unconscious reasons for peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s actions, how emotions affect decisions, and how to apply the principles of persuasion to design Web sites that encourage users to click.\n\nNeuro Web Design employs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œneuro-marketingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ concepts, which are at the intersection of psychology and user experience. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s scientific, yet youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll find it accessible, easy to read, and easy to understand. By applying the concepts and examples in this book, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be able to dramatically increase the effectiveness and conversion rates of your own Web site.\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nSusan Weinschenk has a Ph.D. in Psychology.
