The Hollow Men is also the title of their TV show broadcast in the United States by Comedy Central. The show follows the kind of silliness from sketch comedy shows like Monty Python's Flying Circus and The Kids in the Hall. The first and only season, consisting of six episodes, aired in early 2005. The group's name comes from a grim T.S. Eliot poem. In 2006 they broadcast a BBC Radio 4 sketch show, also of the same name. The radio show was recommissioned and a second series was aired in September 2007. Both series also featured Katy Brand.\n\ncite: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollow_Men_(comedy_troupe) 2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ac6666465e3c95f434adb7bab7a85d7b71f52fe","amp;dn":"The+Hollow+Men+Sketch+Comedy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ac6666465e3c95f434adb7bab7a85d7b71f52fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,198,102,100,101,227,201,95,67,74,219,123,171,122,133,215,183,31,82,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
