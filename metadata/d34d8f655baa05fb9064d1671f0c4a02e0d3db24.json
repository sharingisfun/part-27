II\n\n  Emo-leaning and volatile post-hardcore outfit Dance Gavin Dance, who were somewhat similar to peers Chiodos and the Fall of Troy, featured former members of Farewell Unknown and Ghost Runner on Third, two alums of Seattle's Less Avenged Records. The Sacramento crew comprised vocalists Jonny Craig (later replaced by Kurt Travis) and Jonathan Mess, guitarists Will Swan and Sean O'Sullivan, bassist Eric Lodge, and drummer Matt Mingus. The sextet hooked up with Rise Records in 2006 and debuted that November with the EP Whatever I Say Is Royal Ocean. They released three albums, all of which were issued on Rise, from 2007 through 2009.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d34d8f655baa05fb9064d1671f0c4a02e0d3db24","amp;dn":"Dance+Gavin+Dance+-+Acceptance+Speech+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d34d8f655baa05fb9064d1671f0c4a02e0d3db24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,77,143,101,91,170,5,251,144,100,209,103,31,12,74,2,224,211,219,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
