No more lusting after Lucas, the hot, but emotionless, vampire king who canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t commit. Instead sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to make it work with Jack. After all, not only is he breathing, but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the love of her lifeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.IsnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t he?\n\nValerie is an Empath, with supernatural abilities that seem to do nothing more than give her the hots for Lucas. Once upon a time, EmpathÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s had a purpose. They were ambassadors to the OthersÃ¢â‚¬â€Fey, Witches, Werewolves and Vampires. They could settle the emotions of a Werewolf and make Vampires feel again.\n\nBut that was long ago.\n\nLucas isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t about to let Valerie go. He needs her to help him find the Fey, last seen in the Colony of Roanoke, North Carolina, circa 1587. He still believes they are the key to restoring balance to the world and the only way to keep vampires under control. They wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t trust him, but they will trust Val.\nBetween Jack, Lucas and Rachel, Val knows life wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be dull. Nor will it be the normal, 2.5 kids kind of life sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always wanted.\n\nAs their enemies close in, Val must ask herself what life is really aboutÃ¢â‚¬â€œtrust, duty or mind-blowing orgasms? And even if she finds the answer, she may not live long enough to enjoy it.\n\nPlease noteÃ¢â‚¬â€this novel is not YA and has lots of sass, swearing and sex. Not necessarily in that order. \n\n Sold by: Amazon Digital Services, Inc.\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B006M6XV1Q","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17faaeca6d8a6957a249a18f373c21423ee2a839","amp;dn":"%5BCaroline+Hanson%5DLove+is+Fear+Valerie+Dearborn+Book+2%28azw%2C+epub%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17faaeca6d8a6957a249a18f373c21423ee2a839","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,250,174,202,109,138,105,87,162,73,161,143,55,60,33,66,62,226,168,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
