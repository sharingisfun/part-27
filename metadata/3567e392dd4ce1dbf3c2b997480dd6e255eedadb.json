[The actual written law that imposes the tax].\n\nFrom the begining, due to the strict constitutional limits on their power, Congress imposed a very limited income tax, applicable only to those engaged in foreign and international commerce. That tax was then, and continues to be, grossly misrepresented to the American public so successfully that today it is ?common knowledge? that the income of most Americans is subject to the tax, even though the entire history of written law proves otherwise.\n\nThe product of years of exhaustive research and development, Theft By Deception clearly shows how the current Federal Income Tax law and its legislative history never intended to tax the average American?s domestically earned income.\n\nCombining 3-D animations with a methodical, step-by-step approach, Theft By Deception will unravel the complicated tax law to reveal the very limited nature of the federal income tax. The evidence paints a clear picture that agents of the United States government orchestrated, executed, and then attempted to cover up the most monumental financial fraud in history.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theft-by-deception.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theft-by-deception.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSupport the source if you can...\n\nTech specs:\n\nGeneral #0 \nFileSize/String : 721 MiB \nFormat/String : Audio Video Interleave \nOveralBitRate/String : 1147 Kbps \nPlayTime/String : 1h 27mn \n\nVideo #0 \nCodec/String : divx \nBitRate/String : 1006 Kbps \nWidth : 480 \nHeight : 360 \nAspectRatio/String : 4/3 \nFrameRate/String : 29.97 fps \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.194 \n\nAudio #0 \nCodec/String : MPEG1/2 L3 \nCodec/Info : MPEG1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 \nBitRate/String : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s)/String : 2 channels \nSamplingRate/String : 44 KHz \n\n===============================================================================\nLearn the true nature of the world, come visit our huge dedicated e-library and forums @ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969/index.html&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.info/index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.info/index.php&lt;/a&gt;\n===============================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3567e392dd4ce1dbf3c2b997480dd6e255eedadb","amp;dn":"Theft+By+Deception+-+Deciphering+the+Income+Tax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3567e392dd4ce1dbf3c2b997480dd6e255eedadb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,103,227,146,221,76,225,219,243,194,185,151,72,13,214,226,85,238,218,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
