It begins with an abstract battle of light and darkness set to the music of Beethoveen's Fifth Symphony. Then we see the adventures of a Humpback Whale calf and his pod set to &quot;The Pines of Rome.&quot; Next is the humourous story of several lives in 1930's New York City, scored with &quot;Rhapsody in Blue.&quot; Following is a musical telling of the fairy tale, &quot;The Steadfast Tin Soldier&quot; set to Dmitri Shostakovich's Piano Concerto No. 2. Then a goofy Flamingo causes havoc in his flock with his yo-yo to the tune of the finale of &quot;Carnival of the Animals.&quot; This is followed by the classic sequence from the original film, &quot;The Sorcerer's Apprentice&quot; starring Mickey Mouse and followed by &quot;Pomp and Circumstance&quot; starring Donald Duck as a harried assistant to Noah on his Ark. Finally, we see the awesome tale of the life, death and renewal of a forest in a sequence featuring the composition, &quot;The Firebird.&quot; Written by Kenneth Chisholm\n\nTitle.........: Fantasia 2000\nRuntime.......: 74 Min\nSource........: DVD9 NTSC R1\nGenre.........: Animation/Musical/Fantasy\nIMDB..........: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120910/\n\nASPECTS:\n\n[X] NTSC [ ] PAL        [ ] DVD5 [X] DVD9\n[ ] Widescreen          [ ] Anamorphic\n[ ] Letterbox           [ ] Fullscreen 1.33:1\n\nAUDiO:\n\n[X] English             [X] Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo\n[ ] Spanish             [X] Dolby Digital 5.1\n[X] French              [X] DTS 5.1\n\n                       \nViDEO:                  MENU:            DVD-EXTRAS:\n\n[X] Untouched           [X] Untouched    [X] Untouched\n[ ] Re-Encoded          [ ] Reauthored   [ ] Re-Encoded\n[ ] CCE Passes                           [ ] CCE Passes\n[ ] Partial Stripped                     [ ] Stripped\n\nSUBTiTLES:\n\n[X] English      [ ] Spanish      [X] French\n[ ] Other        [ ] N/A   \n\n\nMessage to the Downloader:\n\nI wish to firstly thank you for choosing my torrents.
