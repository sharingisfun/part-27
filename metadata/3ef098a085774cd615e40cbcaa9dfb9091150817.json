Even the occasional bits of electronica are subsumed by the unhurried and decidedly organic agenda, becoming part of a widescreen aural siesta that is quite unconcerned with its destination. This album requires patience and time from the listener, but when those are afforded it provides a fascinating perspective of those elements in modern music that are often overlooked due to a short attention span. The fruits of this altered perspective are also quite perverse, as their remarkable version of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; convinces without sounding the least bit lethargic or dogmatic.\n\nAnother review: http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4187-fig-5/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ef098a085774cd615e40cbcaa9dfb9091150817","amp;dn":"Jackie-O+Motherfucker+-+Fig.+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ef098a085774cd615e40cbcaa9dfb9091150817","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,240,152,160,133,119,76,214,21,228,12,188,170,157,251,144,145,21,8,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
