Here are all of the brilliantly conceived characters that make up the two worlds of vampires and witches: Mona Mayfair, whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s come to the farm to die and is brought into the realm of the undead; her uncle, Julian Mayfair, guardian of the family, determined to forever torment Lestat for what he has done to Mona; Rowan Mayfair, brilliant neurosurgeon and witch, who finds herself dangerously drawn to the all-powerful Lestat; her husband, Michael Curry, hero of the Mayfair Chronicles, who seeks LestatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s help with the temporary madness of his wife; Ash Templeton, a 5,000-year-old Taltos who has taken MonaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s child; and Patsy, the country-western singer, who returns to avenge her death at the hands of her son, Quinn Blackwood. Delightfully, at the bookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s centre is the Vampire Lestat, once the epitome of evil, now pursuing the transformation set in motion with Memnoch the Devil. He struggles with his vampirism and yearns for goodness, purity and love, as he saves PatsyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ghost from the dark realm of the Earthbound, uncovers the mystery of the Taltos and unselfishly decides the fate of his beloved Rowan Mayfair.\n\nA story of love and loyalty, of the search for passion and promise, Blood Canticle is Anne Rice at her finest","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ed1fce90a2b92b79bf17a0924a56b18cf899fd9","amp;dn":"Blood+canticle+-+Anne+Rice-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ed1fce90a2b92b79bf17a0924a56b18cf899fd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,209,252,233,10,43,146,183,155,241,122,9,36,165,107,24,207,137,159,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
