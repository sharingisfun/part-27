But an escape to Devonshire leads him straight to his destiny in the irresistible form of Phyllida Tallent, a willful, independent beauty of means who brings all his masterful Cynster instincts rioting to the fore. Lucifer isnÃ¢â‚¬Â²t about to deny his desire for Phyllida, and heÃ¢â‚¬Â²s determined to use all his seductive skills to enjoy the benefits of destinyÃ¢â‚¬Â²s choice without submitting to the parsonÃ¢â‚¬Â²s noose.\n\nPhyllida has had a bevy of suitors, her charm and wit are well known throughout the countryside, but none of them has tempted her the way Lucifer does. His offer to teach her all about the ways of love is almost too tantalising to resist. And though sheÃ¢â‚¬Â²s not yet completely surrendered, she knows only a fool stands against a Cynster...and Phyllida is no oneÃ¢â‚¬Â²s fool","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7e829ca72e3c4c16e7954490c583b5f8fa2d575","amp;dn":"Stephine+Laurens+-+All+About+Love+%28Cynster+%236%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7e829ca72e3c4c16e7954490c583b5f8fa2d575","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,232,41,202,114,227,196,193,110,121,84,73,12,88,59,95,143,162,213,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
