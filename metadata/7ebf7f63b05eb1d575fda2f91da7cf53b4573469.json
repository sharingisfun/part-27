Real estate and renovation experts, Property Brothers Drew and Jonathan Scott, come to the rescue and help the couple find a budget-friendly dream home that can be renovated on time. With a budget that doesn't match the couple's expectations, Drew and Jonathan struggle to sell the potential of a fixer-upper. A tough decision between two renovation projects has to be made but the couple is agonized. They finally pull the trigger but the Brothers now only have four weeks to transform the house as promised. Tensions arise when the couple suddenly starts to make big changes that threaten the budget and move-in date, and the brothers worry that the couple are headed for renovation disaster.\nIf you see &quot;Hector&quot; on the end of a file it means I capped it.\nEnjoy, Gaz/Hector :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ebf7f63b05eb1d575fda2f91da7cf53b4573469","amp;dn":"My.Dream.Home.s02e06.PDTV.x264.Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ebf7f63b05eb1d575fda2f91da7cf53b4573469","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,191,127,99,176,94,177,213,117,253,162,249,29,167,207,83,180,87,52,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
