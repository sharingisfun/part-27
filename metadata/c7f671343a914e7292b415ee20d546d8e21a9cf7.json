Every day, Canadian\nsoldiers on the ground confront the chaos and violence of life\n&quot;outside the wire&quot;. They donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have the big picture; theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not\ninterested in the policy. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re just trying to help the people,\nprotect each other...and survive.\n\nAfghanada gives us a gruntsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢-eye-view of the conflict . The sound\nis edgy and gritty, the impact immediate, pushing the listener into\nan auditory journey that is impossible to escape. It is a\nreflection of the very real situation Canadian soldiers are facing\nevery day in Afghanistan.\n\n----\n\nThe Afghanada cast includes Billy MacLellan as Private Lucas\n&quot;Chucky&quot; Manson, Jenny Young as Sergeant Pat &quot;Coach&quot; Kinsella, Paul\nFauteux as Private Dean &quot;The Machine&quot; Donaldson, Jordan Pettle as\nCorporal Jakes, Anousha Alamian as Sami and Khan Soroor.\n\n----\n\nEpisode 01:\n\nThe series begins with five Canadian soldiers and a translator\ntraveling from Kandahar to a local village to establish contact and\ndeliver supplies to a school. Following a successful meeting with\nvillage elders, (a shura,) they proceed to the school but are\nintercepted by the Taliban. One member of the unit disappears.\n\nEpisode 02:\n\nThe Sergeant is missing in action. Master Corporal Pat Kinsella, a\nfemale combat soldier, is made temporary section commander. The\nsection is ordered back to base. On the way back, they are marooned\nin the desert when their Light Armoured Vehicle (LAV) falls into a\ndry river bed during a sandstorm. They make a surprise discovery in\na cave in a mountainside following a strange encounter with a lone\nAmerican soldier.\n\nEpisode 03:\n\nWhile returning to base from a medical mission, an Improvised\nExplosive Device (IED) explodes, disabling their LAV. The section\ncomes under attack when an attempt to borrow a tractor from a local\nfarmer goes sideways. They are rescued by American firepower.\n\nEpisode 04:\n\nAssigned to American command, the section is tasked with hunting\nfor suicide bomb factories in Kandahar. Following a raid on an\nAfghan family, (who could be suicide bombers), the unit comes to a\nmosque and meets a rogue American unit which they suspect is\ninvolved in shady operations. They must decide whether to blow the\nwhistle or not.\n\nEpisode 05:\n\nPrior to a major offensive, Kinsella is replaced as temporary\nsection commander by Master Corporal Jakes from the Provincial\nReconstruction Team. He must gain the trust of the unit in the\nmidst of battle. His lack of experience under fire highlights the\nconsequences of his decisions for the unit.\n\nEpisode 06:\n\nEngaged in the NATO offensive against the Taliban, the unit\nencounters a small group of Afghan National Police (ANP) doing\ntheir best to keep law and order without equipment or supplies.\nTheir attempt to aid the ANP by destroying some Taliban weapons\ncaches embroils them in local tribal politics and worsens the local\nsituation.\n\nEpisode 07:\n\nThe section is assigned with providing security on a Village\nMedical Outreach (VMO). The goal is to improve conditions in rural\nareas and gain the support of the local Afghan population. They run\nafoul of Islamic law while attempting to save a teenage girl who\nhas a fatal infection.\n\nEpisode 08:\n\nChristmas at Kandahar Airfield looks better than being stuck at an\nabandoned American firebase in the mountains on the Pakistan\nborder. In the valley below is a madrassa, that doubles as a\nTaliban training base. While waiting for a possible attack, Private\nDonaldson struggles with the psychological effects of killing an\nenemy fighter.\n\nEpisode 09:\n\nThe Section splits up for the first time in months to take a few\ndays leave. Dean and Lucas fly out to blow off steam in Bangkok and\nSergeant Kinsella heads home to Prince Rupert to see her parents\nand her boyfriend. The boys have a great time sampling many\ndelights forbidden on the job in Afghanistan. Kinsella on the other\nhand finds re-integration into civilian life a complicated\nexperience.\n\nEpisode 10:\n\nOutside the wire once again, the Section heads out on a clandestine\noperation to find and destroy a Taliban command post. This time\nthey have a new interpreter recruited from a local village. When\nthe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œterpÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ begins to consider the risk his family faces from the\nTaliban now that he is helping the NATO forces, he makes a decision\nthat endangers the Section. Private Manson rushes to his defense\neven though it means disobeying a senior officer.\n\nEpisode 11:\n\nAfter barely surviving a river crossing when the bridge collapses\nunder their LAV, the Section finds itself marooned in a remote\nvillage. A Canadian aid agency has been hard at work here and the\nvillage has been turned into a thriving community, the likes of\nwhich they have not seen before. One of the aid workers takes a\nshine to Dean, but the Taliban are not impressed with the success\nof this village and things go horribly wrong.\n\nEpisode 12:\n\nA hearts and minds mission to deliver food aid turns into a quest\nfor the elusive Mullah Omar, leader of the Taliban. Along the way\nthey encounter a former Russian soldier and a strange group of\nwomen farmers. Do they get Omar in the end? Only time will tell.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe album graphics are from another Afghanada encoded at 192 kbps.\nI don't know who's rip that is or who scanned them, but I've\nincluded them here for those who might want them.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7f671343a914e7292b415ee20d546d8e21a9cf7","amp;dn":"Afghanada+Vol.+01","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7f671343a914e7292b415ee20d546d8e21a9cf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,246,113,52,58,145,78,114,146,180,21,238,32,213,70,216,226,26,156,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
