I made it smaller in file size, got rid of the black sidebars, and made it an XviD that is standalone DivX player compatible.  This is the same quality as the original, as far as I can tell.  A sample is included.  Thanks much to the original poster and capper!\n\nXviD: 1389 kbps\nMP3: 48000Hz  128 kb/s tot , Joint Stereo \nResolution: 624x352\nFPS: 29.970 (NTSC)\nLength: 51:37\n\nOriginal file:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92869d03d2c777811c3d791f329463cdef03bde0","amp;dn":"National+Geographic%3A+Inside+The+Green+Berets+%28XviD-MP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92869d03d2c777811c3d791f329463cdef03bde0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,134,157,3,210,199,119,129,28,61,121,31,50,148,99,205,239,3,189,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
