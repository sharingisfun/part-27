They'd been best friends ever since he pushed her down on the playground and she made him eat a mud pie. Somewhere over the years, she fell for him and fell hard. The big problem with that? Kyler puts the 'man' in man-whore. He's never stayed with a girl longer than a few nights, and with it being their last year in college, Syd doesn't want to risk their friendship by declaring her love. \n\nKyler has always put Syd on a pedestal that was too high for him to reach. To him, she's perfect and she's everything. But the feelings he has for her, he's always hidden away or focused on any other female. After all, Kyler will always be the poor boy from the wrong side of tracks, and Syd will always be the one girl he can never have. \n\nBut when they're stranded together at a posh ski resort due to a massive Nor'easter, there's nothing stopping their red-hot feelings for each other from coming to the surface. Can their friendship survive the attraction? Better yet, can they survive at all? Because as the snow falls, someone is stalking them, and this ski trip may be a life-changer in more ways than one.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbaf7beb4f164b891fa27d7431eaf74485340a42","amp;dn":"Frigid+%28Frigid+%231%29+by+J.+Lynn+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbaf7beb4f164b891fa27d7431eaf74485340a42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,175,123,235,79,22,75,137,31,162,125,116,49,234,247,68,133,52,10,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
