From trade wind and rainshadow deserts to interior and coastal deserts, &quot;Deserts&quot; spotlights 10 superlative examples and reveals why these astonishing landforms are never static, but always changing. A dramatic, full-color photographic insert adds visual appeal to this compelling title.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de1ede9efd43c226d752e1329ffbc624a166d357","amp;dn":"Pete+Aleshire%2C+%26ldquo%3BDeserts%26rdquo%3B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de1ede9efd43c226d752e1329ffbc624a166d357","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,30,222,158,253,67,194,38,215,82,225,50,159,251,198,36,161,102,211,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
