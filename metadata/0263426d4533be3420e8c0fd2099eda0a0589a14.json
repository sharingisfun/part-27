But someone would rather the pair never meet, as a horde of street people-under the influence of a deadly new, body-twisting drug made from the blood of an Archangel-are sent to deal with them. Vampirella's mission for Heaven could be over before it's even begun.\n\nThanks goes to Re-em for this release.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7985611/Vampirella_Strikes_v2_1(2012)(2_covers)(c2c)(Re-em-Novus)[NVS-D]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7985611/Vampirella_Strikes_v2_1(2012)(2_covers)(c2c)(Re-em-Novus)[NVS-D]&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0263426d4533be3420e8c0fd2099eda0a0589a14","amp;dn":"Vampirella+Strikes+v2+2%282013%29%282+covers%29%28c2c%29%28Re-em-Novus%29%5BNVS-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0263426d4533be3420e8c0fd2099eda0a0589a14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,99,66,109,69,51,190,52,32,232,192,253,32,153,237,160,160,88,154,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
