August 27, 1521), often referred to simply as Josquin, was a Franco-Flemish composer of the Renaissance. He is also known as Josquin Desprez, a French rendering of Dutch &quot;Josken Van De Velde&quot;, diminutive of &quot;Joseph Van De Velde&quot; (&quot;of the fields). \n\nHe was the most famous European composer between Guillaume Dufay and Palestrina, and is usually considered to be the central figure of the Franco-Flemish School. Josquin is widely considered to be the first master of the high Renaissance style of polyphonic vocal music that was emerging during his lifetime.\nDuring the 16th century, Josquin acquired the reputation as the greatest composer of the age, his mastery of technique and expression universally imitated and admired.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4e67899af0fbe149324d3043759d8a1bfed25c1","amp;dn":"Josquin+1450-1521+%28Exquisite+Renaissance+Choral%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4e67899af0fbe149324d3043759d8a1bfed25c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,230,120,153,175,15,190,20,147,36,211,4,55,89,216,161,191,237,37,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
