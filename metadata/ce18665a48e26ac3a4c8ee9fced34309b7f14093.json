And although I'm positive there were far more recorded than the four albums which I am sharing today, unfortunately only these four albums from 1954 ever have made their way into my collection over the years.  And in turn, into your collection today.\n\nThere are 4 albums being shared today, including...\n\n * Blackwood Brothers - 1954 - I'm Bound For That City\n * Blackwood Brothers - 1954 - Vintage Years\n * Eddy Arnold - 1954 - When It's Round Up Time In Heaven\n * George Lewis - 1954 - Jazz At Vespers\n\nFor Him,\nTorrentTracts, May 2014\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce18665a48e26ac3a4c8ee9fced34309b7f14093","amp;dn":"1954+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+01%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce18665a48e26ac3a4c8ee9fced34309b7f14093","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,24,102,90,72,226,106,195,164,200,238,159,206,211,67,9,183,241,64,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
