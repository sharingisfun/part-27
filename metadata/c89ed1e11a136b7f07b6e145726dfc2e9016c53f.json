It seems as though she's finally managed to find and record a set of songs that suit her 100%. Maybe this isn't surprising when you consider the musical genius that went into writing and scoring the album. Most of the material was written and arranged by TV producer, jazz-pianist, composer, &amp;quot;rarely-out-of-the-news-man-about-town&amp;quot; Berndt Egerbladh. Lyrical assistance was generously provided by a 6 foot kiltless Scottish giant, Francis Cowan. Francis also plays the cello on a few tracks which explains why he's kiltless. Anyway, quite a combination which gave a fantastic result, with a little help from producer, HÃƒÂ¥kan Sterner. Incidentally, HÃƒÂ¥kan found the job so exciting that he was forced to retreat behind a beard after it's completion.\n  Doris' album provides 36 minutes of qualified musical joy guaranteed to satisfy all tastes. Discotheques will find that two numbers in particular, &amp;quot;Don't&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Beatmaker&amp;quot; are good box office draws. Jazz die-hards might even start visiting discothequesa after digesting &amp;quot;I Wish I Knew&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I'm Pushing You Out&amp;quot;. Note too an incredible ballad called &amp;quot;Daisies&amp;quot; and tell me if Sweden hasn't produced a dangerous competitor for Melanie.\n  Once again, this LP's got something for everybody, the best of underground, jazz, rock and folk - not mixed up in one gigantic hotch-potch, but all in gentle harmony. Listen to Doris - a good time will be had by all.\n\nlÃƒÂ¥t 1-12 frÃƒÂ¥n LP'n &amp;quot;Did you give the world some love today Baby&amp;quot; 1970\nlÃƒÂ¥t 13-16, 18, 21 singlar med Plums 1966-70\nlÃƒÂ¥t 17, 19, 22 singlar med Dandys 1969-70\nlÃƒÂ¥t 20 singel med Sven Olof Walldoffs orchestra 1969","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c89ed1e11a136b7f07b6e145726dfc2e9016c53f","amp;dn":"Doris+-+Did+You+Give+the+World+Some+Love+Baby+%5BExpanded%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c89ed1e11a136b7f07b6e145726dfc2e9016c53f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,158,209,225,26,19,107,127,7,182,225,69,114,109,252,46,144,22,197,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
