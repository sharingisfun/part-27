A new individual picks up the helmet of an older Crimson Dynamo - and it wants very badly to be re-united with the armor unit to complete the set once more. Much mayhem ensues as a result.\n\nThese are all six issues in original scans, with no credit listed. Thanks to the scanners for their efforts. This fills a request from KAT. Please seed, and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d53d0a02cfe6ad891a0c704af7bc13b050c2ec6c","amp;dn":"Crimson+Dynamo+01-06+%282003-2004%7CEpic%29+%5BREQUESTED%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d53d0a02cfe6ad891a0c704af7bc13b050c2ec6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,61,10,2,207,230,173,137,26,12,112,74,247,188,19,176,80,194,236,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
