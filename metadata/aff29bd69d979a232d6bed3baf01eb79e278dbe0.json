Cable television, book publishers, and a bewildering array of websites tell us that human history is a tapestry of aliens, Atlantis, monsters, and more. But is there any truth to these Ã¢â‚¬Å“alternativesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to mainstream history? Since 2001, skeptical xenoarchaeologist Jason Colavito has investigated the weird, the wild, and the wacky in search of the truth about ancient history. He interrogates Ã¢â‚¬Å“alternativeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ historyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most important claims to reveal the real facts that sit behind the speculation. What you are about to read is a collection of fifty of ColavitoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best essays on fake history and false claims, covering everything from Atlantis to Chupacabra to Stonehenge to UFOs, and even the demonic power of the humble dinner fork. Across these essays Colavito shines the light of reason to separate fact from speculation, to expose lies and fraud, and to get to the bottom of whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s behind claims for ancient astronauts and Ã¢â‚¬Å“alternativeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ historyÃ¢â‚¬â€drawing on the actual ancient texts TVÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s talking heads donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want you to actually read.
