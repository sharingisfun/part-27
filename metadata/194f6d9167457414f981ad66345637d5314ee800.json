They gave me the land--and a property tax bill for two million dollars. Which is why I, Nora Blackbird, a former socialite who never really held a job in all of my thirty-one years, found myself in dire need of a paycheck. . .&quot;\nNow Nora has a job as a society page columnist for a Philadelphia paper. This downÃ¢â‚¬â€and almost,Ã¢â‚¬â€out former debutante is happy to reclaim her place within the city's elite. Until her first party assignment, when she stumbles upon the murdered body of the hostÃ¢â‚¬â€a millionaire art collector and old family friend. Her sistersÃ¢â‚¬â€sexy, hard-edged Emma and flaky earth mother Libby, who has her hands full with husband number two and four kidsÃ¢â‚¬â€only complicate matters as Nora investigates.

After PopoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body is found on a display bed in the luxurious HaymakerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s department store, Nora Blackbird is forced to put solving a murder before finishing her Christmas shopping.

LibbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hormones are in overdrive from selling paraphernalia for Potions and Passions, a company that promises its customers full satisfaction.

Now Nora must find the killer before her innocent lover takes the rap. That means shadowing the most glamorous suspects in PhiladelphiaÃ¢â‚¬â€including a bad-boy designer, a former child star, a high-strung ad exec, and a pair of luscious twin models. Though NoraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s accustomed to upper-crust murder, cross your fingers for the Blackbird sisters, because this time, high society has never seemed so low-down dirty.\n\nHave Your Cake and Kill Him Too (Book 5)\nWhen the tycoon owner of a spectacularly tacky sports bar is killed, Nora Blackbird suspects a secretive politician, a shady former rock star doubling as a pastry chef, and a dangerous aristo-brat on the verge of stardom.\n\nA Crazy Little Thing Called Death (Book 6)\nImpoverished Philadelphia heiress Nora Blackbird has agreed to wed Mick Abruzzo, son of New Jersey's most notorious mobster, leaving the city's bluebloods in shock.

Now it's up to the Blackbird sisters to snoop among the snooty-until they uncover the truth.\n\nMurder Melts in Your Mouth (Book 7)\nDown-to-earth debutante Nora Blackbird is having a meltdown-and it isn't because of Philadelphia's heat wave, or an overdose at the city's Chocolate Festival. A noted Philly philanthropist has taken a swan dive from an office balcony-and Nora's friend Lexie stands accused of the murder. Then Nora's scheming parents reappear, sending all three Blackbird sisters into a panic. Now Nora must uncover the scandalous hijinks her parents are plotting-before she winds up taking all the heat and strangling her father with his own ascot.\n\nNo Way to Kill a Lady (Book 8)\nNora Blackbird, the Bucks County ex-debutante with a haute couture wardrobe, a hot job as a glamorous society columnist and a stone cold bank account, might finally have her own life just right, but everyone around her is going down in flames. Her sister Libby seems destined to be the lead character in a tabloid sex scandal. Her sister Emma is expecting a mysterious love child. Her best friend, Lexie Paine, is serving time in the slammer. And now her mobbed-up boyfriend, Mick AbruzzoÃ¢â‚¬â€who might actually be her husbandÃ¢â‚¬â€is conducting clandestine capers from Blackbird Farm while under house arrest. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a good girl to do? \nFind a killer, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what! Word arrives that the sistersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ great aunt, Madeleine Blackbird, has died in a volcanic eruption on an Indonesian island and left her fabulous country estate, worth millions, to the three of them. But when the Blackbird sisters show up to claim their windfall, they find the house in a state of disheartening decay and all of MadeleineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to-die-for treasures gone. Worse, the mansion has been hiding a grisly secret: the body of a woman who died there many years ago. All the evidence points to a high society murder...\nNoraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s special bond with flamboyant Aunt Madeleine compels her to seek out the truth. With her auntÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s amorous stepson dogging her footsteps, her unscrupulous lawyer acting like a skunk, and her devoted housekeeper not to be found, NoraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s investigation is going nowhere. Good thing MickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s close by to offer Nora distractions both dark and delightful. And, as ever, her irrepressible sisters provide some unexpected... and highly unorthodox... assistance when she most needs it.\n\nLittle Black Book of Murder (Book 9)\nNora Blackbird may have been to the manor borne, but these days money is so tight, she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t afford to lose her job as a society columnist. So when her new boss at the Philadelphia IntelligencerÃ¢â‚¬â€Australian tabloid editor Gus HardwickeÃ¢â‚¬â€tells her to work the celebrity gossip beat or start checking the want ads, the choice is easy.\nNow NoraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writing a profile on billionaire fashion designer Swain Starr, who recently retired to build a high-tech organic farm with his new wife, Zephyr, a former supermodel. But before Nora can get the story, the mogul is murdered. And now Gus wants her to snap up an exclusive on who killed Starr before the cops do.\nBut solving a celebrity murder isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t easy with a home life as colorful as NoraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. Her sort-of-husband, Mick, a former mobster, is associating once again with unsavory characters. Her sister Libby is on a mission to get her diabolical twins on stage or screen with the help of an unscrupulous former child star. And the youngest Blackbird sister, Emma, just got kicked out of the house by MickÃ¢â‚¬â€who refuses to explain why.\nIf anything can bring the blue-blooded Blackbird sisters together, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a murder investigation involving high-society events, glamorous people, and the disappearance of a genetically perfect pig that may or may not be basking in the sun at Blackbird Farm. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll all have to pull together this time, because if Nora canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bring home the bacon, she might have to exchange her bucolic estate for a cramped walk-up.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:194f6d9167457414f981ad66345637d5314ee800","amp;dn":"Blackbird+Sisters+Mystery+by+Nancy+Martin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"194f6d9167457414f981ad66345637d5314ee800","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,79,109,145,103,69,116,20,249,129,173,102,52,86,55,213,49,78,232,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
