With a wisp of white smoke, Duran Duran appeared with arms in the air. The band soon launched the show with &quot;Before the Rain&quot;, a ballad from All You Need Is Now.\n\nVisual treats included a winged phoenix dancing-fire-women, which made a red and gold backdrop for &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;.\n\nDuring &quot;Come Undone&quot;, someone near the front of the stage blew Simon Le Bon a kiss, which, with his arm outstretched he caught.\n\nBefore &quot;The Reflex&quot;, Le Bon asked for a 'Mancunian bloke' to help start the singing off. 'Dean' was then ushered to the front where Le Bon kindly offered to hold his pint (and took a drink, singing the &quot;Da na na na&quot; in the microphone that was then lopped). The rest of the audience then joined in.\n\n&quot;The Man Who Stole A Leopard&quot; was performed with a video, featuring Nina Hossain presenting the news report.\n\n&quot;Girl Panic&quot; pumped out adrenalin with its energetic Latino groove, while the accompanying music video starring Yasmin Le Bon, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Eva Herzigova, and Helena Christensen was played behind in synchronization with Le Bon's singing.\n\nLe Bon told the audience he was a twitter addict, &quot;If you're feeling the itch, message #Duranlive,&quot;. He later summed up the whole night by saying, &quot;I just love music, here we all are on the same side!&quot;\n\nA highly charged encore of &quot;The Wild Boys&quot; and &quot;Rio&quot; closed the show.\n\nTrack listingEdit\nDVD:\n&quot;Return To Now&quot; (Title Sequence)\n&quot;Before the Rain&quot;\n&quot;Planet Earth&quot;\n&quot;A View to a Kill&quot;\n&quot;All You Need Is Now&quot;\n&quot;Blame the Machines&quot;\n&quot;Safe (In the Heat of the Moment)&quot;\n&quot;The Reflex&quot;\n&quot;The Man Who Stole A Leopard&quot;\n&quot;Girl Panic!&quot;\n&quot;White Lines&quot;\n&quot;Careless Memories&quot;\n&quot;Ordinary World&quot;\n&quot;Notorious&quot;\n&quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot;\n&quot;(Reach Up for The) Sunrise&quot;\n&quot;The Wild Boys&quot; / &quot;Relax&quot;\n&quot;Rio&quot;\n&quot;A Diamond in the Mind&quot; (Credits)\nBonus features:\nDuran Duran 2011 (Documentary)\n&quot;Come Undone&quot;\n&quot;Is There Something I Should Know?&quot;\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20f848e566e7500feecfdee17bb113642516d98c","amp;dn":"Duran+Duran+-+A+Diamond+in+the+Mind+-+Live+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20f848e566e7500feecfdee17bb113642516d98c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,248,72,229,102,231,80,15,238,207,222,225,123,177,19,100,37,22,217,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
