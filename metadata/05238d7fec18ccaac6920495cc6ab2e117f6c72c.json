With this objective, the book is divided into two main parts.\n\nIn the first part, after an introduction concerning the basics on derivative securities, the authors explain how to establish the adequate PDE initial/initial-boundary value problems for different sets of derivative products (vanilla and exotic options, and interest rate derivatives). For many option problems, the analytic solutions are also derived with details. The second part is devoted to explaining and analyzing the application of finite differences techniques to the financial models stated in the first part of the book. For this, the authors recall some basics on finite difference methods, initial boundary value problems, and (having in view financial products with early exercise feature) linear complementarity and free boundary problems. In each chapter, the techniques related to these mathematical and numerical subjects are applied to a wide variety of financial products.\n\nThis is a textbook for graduate students following a mathematical finance program as well as a valuable reference for those researchers working in numerical methods of financial derivatives. For this new edition, the book has been updated throughout with many new problems added. More details about numerical methods for some options, for example, Asian options with discrete sampling, are provided and the proof of solution-uniqueness of derivative security problems and the complete stability analysis of numerical methods for two-dimensional problems are added.  \n\n Review of first edition:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦the book is highly well designed and structured as a textbook for graduate students following a mathematical finance program, which includes Black-Scholes dynamic hedging methodology to price financial derivatives. Also, it is a very valuable reference for those researchers working in numerical methods in financial derivatives, either with a more financial or mathematical background.&quot; -- MATHEMATICAL REVIEWS, 2005\n\nContent Level Ã‚Â» Graduate\n\n\nAUTHORS &amp; EDITORS\nYou-Lan Zhu is a Professor of Mathematics at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Xiaonan Wu is a Professor of Mathematics at Hong Kong Baptist University. I-Liang Chern is a Professor of Mathematics at National Taiwan University.
