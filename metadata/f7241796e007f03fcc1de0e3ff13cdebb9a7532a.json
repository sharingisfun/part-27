Following issues are corrected in Windows high DPI mode:\r\n\r\na) if text size in Windows settings was set to 150% or larger,\r\nthe font size in WinRAR help was not increased accordingly,\r\nresulting in too small text;\r\n\r\nb) default columns width in WinRAR file list was less\r\nthan expected for 125% or larger Windows text setting.\r\n\r\n2. Interface improvements for right to left languages:\r\n\r\na) proper text alignment in simple WinRAR prompts, such as\r\nconfirmations to delete archived files or to clear the log file;\r\n\r\nb) &quot;OK&quot;, &quot;Cancel&quot;, &quot;Help&quot; buttons in multi-page dialogs,\r\nsuch as archiving and extraction options or WinRAR settings,\r\nare aligned correctly and translated to default Windows\r\ndisplay language.\r\n\r\n3. Bugs fixed:\r\n\r\na) WinRAR SFX module could load DLL libraries from its own executable\r\nfolder as a result of calling some Windows API functions.\r\nIt could lead to security threat if DLL files with malicious code\r\nwere stored in the same folder as SFX archive. Now SFX module\r\ntakes additional steps to prevent such situation in Windows Vista\r\nand newer.\r\n\r\nBe aware that users without latest Windows security patches\r\ninstalled also as Windows XP users still can be affected,\r\nso they must be especially careful to run SFX archive from\r\na folder without suspicious DLL files;\r\n\r\nb) WinRAR 5.30 failed to run .lnk files from file list.\r\n\r\nIt is Pre-Activated, so just install and use it. No need to use any crack, patch or license. Its already activated with lifetime licensed for unlimited Company.\r\nNo virus, No malware. 100% Clean Install","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7241796e007f03fcc1de0e3ff13cdebb9a7532a","amp;dn":"WinRAR+5.31+Final%28x86-x64%29+Pre-Activated+100%25+Clean+Insta","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7241796e007f03fcc1de0e3ff13cdebb9a7532a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,36,23,150,224,7,240,63,204,29,224,227,255,19,205,235,185,167,83,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
