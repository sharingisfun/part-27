A college student visiting her brassy, unconventional aunt stumbles on an astonishing secret and its meaning in her own life. An incorrigible philanderer responds with unexpected grace to his wifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nursing-home romance. Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage is Munro at her best, tirelessly observant, serenely free of illusion, deeply and gloriously humane.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e1451baf9fbbcb81d157b45d9315bf3c3880067","amp;dn":"Hateship%2C+Friendship%2C+Courtship%2C+Loveship%2C+Marriage+-+Alice+Munr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e1451baf9fbbcb81d157b45d9315bf3c3880067","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,20,81,186,249,251,188,184,29,21,123,69,217,49,91,243,195,136,0,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
