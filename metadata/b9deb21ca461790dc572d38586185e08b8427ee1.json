Based on the song by folk music troubadour Arlo Guthrie, son of legendary &quot;Dust Bowl&quot; balladeer Woody Guthrie, this tribute film to the lost generation features memorable scenes with other folk artists like Pete Seeger, who join Arlo in song to make a profound statement about war, protest and change.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064002/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064002/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Type:                               XVID                           \nDuration                                        1:50:47                            \nFrame Width:                                    720                  \nFrame Height (pixels):                          480                  \nFrames Per Second:                              23          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):                           1309                 \n                                         \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:                                    Lame MP3                   \nAudio Sample Rate:                              48000             \nAudio Bitrate:                                  128                 \nAudio Bitrate Type:                             CBR            \nAudio Channel Count:                            2\t\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9deb21ca461790dc572d38586185e08b8427ee1","amp;dn":"Alice%5C%27s+Restaurant+DvDrip+%5BEng%5D+-+cOOt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9deb21ca461790dc572d38586185e08b8427ee1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,222,178,28,164,97,121,13,197,114,211,133,134,24,94,8,184,66,126,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
