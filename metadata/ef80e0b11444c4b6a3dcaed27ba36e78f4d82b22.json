The disk image is an exact copy of a physical disk (floppy, CD-ROM, hard disk, USB, VHD disk, etc.) or a partition that preserves the original structure. With WinImage in place, you can recreate the disk image on the hard drive or other media, view its content, extract image-based files, add new files and directories, change the format, and defragment the image. All this and more is delivered in one intuitive user interface that enables imaging right out of the box.\n\nWinImage has many cool features!\n\n * Create a disk image from a removable drive (like USB drive), CD-ROM, floppy,\n * Extract file(s) from a disk image,\n * Create empty disk images,\n * Inject files and directories into an existing disk image,\n * Change a disk image format,\n * Defragment a disk image,\n * A powerful &quot;Batch assistant&quot; mode that lets you automate many operations,\n * And many more! \n\nNew for version 8.10\n# Compatibility with VMWare Vmdk Disk image.\n# fixes for Windows Vista compatibility problem.\n\nNew for version 8.00\n# Compatibility with Virtual Hard Disk image (used by MicrosoftÃ‚Â« Virtual PC and Virtual Server), in both read only or read/write mode.\n# Support of NTFS and Linux EXT2FS/EXT3FS image (only in read only mode)\n# Connecting on Linux partition (to view content of Linux partition on connected hard disk)\n# Speed improvement in read of write password encrypted file\n\netc. etc.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef80e0b11444c4b6a3dcaed27ba36e78f4d82b22","amp;dn":"WinImage.8.10.8100.Incl.Keygen-ONY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef80e0b11444c4b6a3dcaed27ba36e78f4d82b22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,128,224,177,20,68,196,182,163,220,174,210,123,163,110,120,244,216,43,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
