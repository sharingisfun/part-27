(1964), a horrible horror film featuring bargain basement musical numbers, an unintelligible soundtrack, a ferret-faced leading man, a gypsy fortune teller with a huge mole, and a guy who talks like Latka Gravas from &quot;Taxi&quot; (1978). Meanwhile, Crow and Servo hit up Mike for the Walk-A-Thon. Pearl takes a trio of preternatural kids back to their omnipotent parents. Professor Bobo and Observer talk to Mike via a CNN-like live broadcast. Crow uses Servo as a crystal ball to scam Mike out of fifty cents. Mike and the 'bots get new 'dos. Crow hires Ortega from the film to cater Servo's First Communion. Crow and Servo build a roller coaster for Mike.\n\n\nSeason 9, Episode 12","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f502ea37d751f390f4ad9b1e959b6e5aad77b4e","amp;dn":"Mystery+Science+Theater+3000+%3A+The+Incredibly+Strange+Creatures+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f502ea37d751f390f4ad9b1e959b6e5aad77b4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,80,46,163,125,117,31,57,15,74,217,177,233,89,182,229,170,215,123,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
