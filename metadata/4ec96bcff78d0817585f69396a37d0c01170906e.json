Big means &quot;back to the future&quot; for the band and its unique sonic world of sound. Although a lot of the track titles might sound familiar, this is anything but your average &quot;greatest hits&quot; collection. Instead, De Phazz rise to the occasion and reinterpret their best and most successful songs with a bit of an ironic smile on their faces and &quot;a little help&quot; from a real, full blown big band. And so it comes as no surprise that all songs on Big organically develop quite a stylish and tasty life of their own, extending the huge potential of the original compositions in many exciting directions.
