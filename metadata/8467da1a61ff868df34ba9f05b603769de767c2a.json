It guides you step by step from simple tests to tests that are maintainable, readable, and trustworthy. It covers advanced subjects like mocks, stubs, and frameworks such as Typemock Isolator and Rhino Mocks. And you'll learn about advanced test patterns and organization, working with legacy code and even untestable code. The book discusses tools you need when testing databases and other technologies. It's written for .NET developers but others will also benefit from this book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8467da1a61ff868df34ba9f05b603769de767c2a","amp;dn":"Manning+The+Art+of+Unit+Testing+May+2009+.Net+examples","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8467da1a61ff868df34ba9f05b603769de767c2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,103,218,26,97,255,134,141,243,75,169,240,91,96,55,105,222,118,124,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
