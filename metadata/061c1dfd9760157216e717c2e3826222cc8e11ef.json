Rauschenberg is well known for his &quot;Combines&quot; of the 1950s, in which non-traditional materials and objects were employed in innovative combinations. Rauschenberg was both a painter and a sculptor and the Combines are a combination of both, but he also worked with photography, printmaking, papermaking, and performance. He was awarded the National Medal of Arts in 1993. He became the recipient of the Leonardo da Vinci World Award of Arts in 1995 in recognition of his more than 40 years of fruitful artmaking","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:061c1dfd9760157216e717c2e3826222cc8e11ef","amp;dn":"Rauschenberg+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"061c1dfd9760157216e717c2e3826222cc8e11ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,28,29,253,151,96,21,114,22,231,23,194,227,130,98,34,204,142,17,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
