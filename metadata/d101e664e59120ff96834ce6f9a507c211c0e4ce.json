The slow-burn follow-up, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Eggshells,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is more indicative of the LP as a whole, pairing deep, trip-hop-kissed beats with emotionally charged vocals; in this case itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a deeply Auto-Tuned Hales locking horns with English soul singer Lianne La Havas. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Be Beautiful Feat. Luke Sital-Singh,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hearts (Spinwheeloscillate) Feat. Prides,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the worldbeat-blasted, Josef Salvat-assisted Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shame on MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ flirt with Coldplay-infused Brit-pop, but much of 10 Futures sounds like the work of the man responsible for penning 2002Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Strange &amp; Beautiful.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Excessive James Blake-approved balladry aside, HalesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ acumen for production is on full display here, as 10 Futures is a marvel of meticulous engineering, and while the material doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always live up to the sonic grandstanding, it never suffers because of it.\nRating 8.5/10\n\nTracklist:\n01-01 Tape 2 Tape (feat.
