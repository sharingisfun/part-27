It details his life all the way from his upbringing in New York to winning the WWF Championship from The Rock in December 1998. Foley had originally wanted the book to be called Blood and Sweatsocks, but this was later added as a sub-title. The book debuted at #3 on the New York Times Best Seller List on November 7, 1999 and reached #1 on December 5.[1] The book is followed by two sequels. Foley is Good: And The Real World is Faker Than Wrestling released in 2001, wraps up the rest of his career and gives a behind the scenes look at the making of Have a Nice Day. The second sequel and third volume to the Foley autobiography is called The Hardcore Diaries and was released in March 2007.\n\nRead By Mick Foley.\n\nTotal Duration 03:18:18\n\nFormat MP3 | 112KBPS \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHuge selection of audiobooks available at the blog.\n\nPlease take the time to click on a few ads.
