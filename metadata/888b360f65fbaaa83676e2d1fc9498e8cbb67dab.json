Although she grew up singing in church, she is not a gospel singer. Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan are clear influences, but she is not a jazz singer. R&amp;B is also part of her background, but she is not really a soul singer, either, at least not in the sense that Aretha Franklin is. Sophisticated is a word often used to describe her musical approach and the music she sings, but she is not a singer of standards such as Lena Horne or Nancy Wilson. What is she, then? She is a pop singer of a sort that perhaps could only have emerged out of the Brill Building environment of post-Elvis Presley, pre-Beatles urban pop in the early '60s. That's when she hooked up with Burt Bacharach and Hal David, songwriters and producers who wrote their unusually complicated songs for her aching yet detached alto voice. Warwick is inescapably associated with those songs, even though she managed to build a career after leaving Bacharach and David that drew upon their style for other memorable recordings, such that she remains a unique figure in popular music.\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info\n\n\n01.Only Trust Your Heart\n02.You I Love\n03.I'm A Fool To Want You\n04.Wonder Why\n05.If You Can Dream\n06.The Second Time Around\n07.Come Out, Come Out Wherever You Are\n08.I'll Never Stop Loving You\n09.Some Other Time\n10.I Fall In Love Too Easily\n11.Keep Me In Mind\n12.And Then You Kissed Me\n13.Pocketful Of Miracles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:888b360f65fbaaa83676e2d1fc9498e8cbb67dab","amp;dn":"Dionne+Warwick+-+Only+Trust+Your+Heart+2011+++CBR320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"888b360f65fbaaa83676e2d1fc9498e8cbb67dab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,139,54,15,101,251,170,168,54,118,226,209,252,148,152,232,203,182,125,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
