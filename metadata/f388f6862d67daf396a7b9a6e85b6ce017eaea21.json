But the craftsmanship and elegance of these designs can still provide inspiration for your own. In this short course, designer Nigel French provides a historical background on Victorian type and then takes you through a step-by-step process to create a new design inspired by a nineteenth-century original. He shows how to choose period-appropriate typefaces and demonstrates Illustrator and Photoshop techniques applicable to any time frame, including skewed type paths, offset shadows, woodcut-style shading, framing devices, and texture.\n\nCheck out the Pinterest board for this course at Victorian Typography for more inspiration.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f388f6862d67daf396a7b9a6e85b6ce017eaea21","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Type+Project%3A+Victorian+Ad+with+Nigel+French","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f388f6862d67daf396a7b9a6e85b6ce017eaea21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,136,246,134,45,103,218,243,150,167,185,166,232,91,108,224,23,234,234,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
