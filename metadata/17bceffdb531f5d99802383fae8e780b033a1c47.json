An album with one side containing music from Star Wars and the other music from 2001. I have no idea how this came about, but the arrangements of the Start Wars stuff are quite a bit different than the ones we are all familiar with from the official soundtracks. It is performed by the London Symphony Orchestra with the first side conducted by Colin Frecther and the second by Douglas Gamley. Recorded under the direction of D.L. Miller and released on the Stereo Gold Award label. Catalog number SGA 1000. Manufactured by Damil Record Sales, Clementon, NJ. I've owned this since I was a child and have never seen anything like it anywhere in my life. I thought it must be a rarity of a sort and decided it should be offered up here.\n\nSIDE 1\n\n01 Main Title\n02 Imperial Attack\n03 Princess Leia's Theme\n04 Ben's Death and TIE Fighter Attack\n05 Land of the Sandpeople\n06 The Return Home\n07 End Title\n\nSIDE 2\n\n08 Theme From 2001\n09 Mercury\n10 Venus\n11 Battle of the Planets (Mars)\n12 Stellar Caprice\n\n\nI will be offering up another peculiar Star Wars album soon.\n\nMore to come.
