The race will actually start on the 1,200' long Pismo Beach pier and head east past several vineyards and local ranches. Arroyo Grande will host the first Sprint of Stage 5. As the route then heads south towards a finish along the beach in Santa Barbara, the racers will go past some of the most renown wineries in the USA. As the race passes through Los Olivos on Hwy 154, some of the riders might think it is just a flat run to the coast. The experienced riders will know the HC climb up the San Marcos Pass is waiting just ahead. The descent into Santa Barbara is steep and fast. Is there any more picturesque way to finish than where the mountains meet the sea in Santa Barbara?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddda13e5308d4062d182762e851228daee918ece","amp;dn":"2014+Amgen+Tour+of+California+-+Stage+5+-+Pismo+Beach+to+Santa+B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddda13e5308d4062d182762e851228daee918ece","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,218,19,229,48,141,64,98,209,130,118,46,133,18,40,218,238,145,142,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
