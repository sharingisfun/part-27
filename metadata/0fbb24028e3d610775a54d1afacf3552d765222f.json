Deacon, &quot;Incomplete Nature: How Mind Emerged from Matter&quot;\n2012 | ISBN: 0393049914 | 624 pages | EPUB | 3 MB\n\nA radical new explanation of how life and consciousness emerge from physics and chemistry.\nAs physicists work toward completing a theory of the universe and biologists unravel the molecular complexity of life, a glaring incompleteness in this scientific vision becomes apparent. The &quot;Theory of Everything&quot; that appears to be emerging includes everything but us: the feelings, meanings, consciousness, and purposes that make us (and many of our animal cousins) what we are. These most immediate and incontrovertible phenomena are left unexplained by the natural sciences because they lack the physical propertiesÃ¢â‚¬â€such as mass, momentum, charge, and locationÃ¢â‚¬â€that are assumed to be necessary for something to have physical consequences in the world. This is an unacceptable omission. We need a &quot;theory of everything&quot; that does not leave it absurd that we exist.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fbb24028e3d610775a54d1afacf3552d765222f","amp;dn":"Incomplete+Nature%3A+How+Mind+Emerged+from+Matter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fbb24028e3d610775a54d1afacf3552d765222f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,187,36,2,142,61,97,7,117,165,77,26,250,207,53,82,215,101,34,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
