The game consists of 1 introduction, 23 main levels, and 14 mini levels, 2 of which are &quot;Mini Games.&quot;[4] created by SCE Studio Cambridge, and are based around seven different themes that draw inspiration from real-world locations including the Chinese gardens, dry Australian deserts and icy Alpine stages.[5] Though most of these levels look similar to their PlayStation 3 counterpart they are, in fact, new redesigned levels. Players must traverse complicated mazes during levels using devices including switches, rotating platforms and floating lanterns that can be ridden or grabbed. The main objective of each level is to move from one side of the stage to the other, dodging deadly contraptions such as electric snakes shooting out and trying to kill your sackperson.[4]\nThe game's overall goal is to capture prize bubbles which include stickers, costumes, materials, and objects players may use to customize their own Sackboy and levels. Players can create their own levels from a blank slate or template using various items gained in the game and items ready-made by the game's developers. These levels can then be uploaded to the game's online servers to be shared among the community.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nENJOY GAMING!\nCOMMENTS ARE APPRECIATED!![\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cecb0acdcca7c26ed2b98655e8b5c5f579419c70","amp;dn":"%5BPSP%5D+Little+Big+Planet%28CSO%29%7E%7E%28TIMETHIEF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cecb0acdcca7c26ed2b98655e8b5c5f579419c70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,203,10,205,204,167,194,110,210,185,134,85,232,181,197,245,121,65,156,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
