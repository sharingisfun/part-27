Given its origins, it's little wonder that The Wall paints such an \nunsympathetic portrait of the rock star, cleverly named &quot;Pink,&quot; who blames everyone\nparticularly women -- for his neuroses. Such lyrical and thematic shortcomings may \nhave been forgivable if the album had a killer batch of songs, but Waters took his \noperatic inclinations to heart, constructing the album as a series of fragments that \nare held together by larger numbers like &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; and &quot;Hey You.&quot; Generally, \nthe fully developed songs are among the finest of Pink Floyd's later work, but The Wall \nis primarily a triumph of production: its seamless surface, blending melodic fragments \nand sound effects, makes the musical shortcomings and questionable lyrics easy to ignore.\nBut if The Wall is examined in depth, it falls apart, since it doesn't offer enough great \nsongs to support its ambition, and its self-serving message and shiny production seem \nlike relics of the late-'70s Me Generation.\n \ninfo...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pastebin.com/Bj4bPGmA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pastebin.com/Bj4bPGmA&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:578973d95619010bc412d5cbc533db66497b2ce2","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+The+Wall+Experience+Ed+2012+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D%28oan%29%26trade","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"578973d95619010bc412d5cbc533db66497b2ce2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,137,115,217,86,25,1,11,196,18,213,203,197,51,219,102,73,123,44,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
