The dynamic songwriter was born in Decatur, GA, only a few miles outside of Atlanta. Addicted to TV talent shows like Star Search and Showtime at the Apollo, she was already plotting out her career in music at age 12. Even though her mother hired a piano teacher to encourage those talents, she mainly wanted to sing; therefore, Hilson converted those sessions into vocal lessons, accompanying the teacher on piano. In her mid- to late teens, she jump-started her career as a songwriter and background vocalist, working under producer Anthony Dent (Destinys Child, Diddy). Born out of that relationship were two failed girl groups (named Pretty Toni and D\\'Sign) and, more importantly, a host of connections within the industry for whom she wrote or did backup vocals, including Usher, Ludacris, Kelly Rowland, Ciara, and up-and-coming Southern rap producer Polow da Don.\n\n\n-------[Discography]----------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist: Keri Hilson\nGnere: R&amp;B/Soul\nStudio Albums: \nIn A Perfect World...

Few rap producers were capable of such a balance between commerce and craft. Timbaland produced an endless list of hits, primarily for a select group of affiliates (Missy Elliott, Aaliyah, Jay-Z, Ginuwine) though also for a number of other A-list artists (Ludacris, Snoop Dogg, Nas, Justin Timberlake). Even so, he always infused a remarkable sense of individuality and creativity into his productions. When you hear a Timbaland production generally there is no mistaking it for anyone else\\'s work: stuttering bass-heavy bounce beats offset resounding high-end synth stabs, all of this often complemented by his own signature-like quiet murmuring beneath the track; and no sampling. However, over time Timbaland began taking an increasingly assembly-line approach to production, working with a team of co-producers and songwriters including Nathaniel \\&quot;Danjahandz\\&quot; Hills, the Clutch, and Justin Timberlake. Plus, he began producing an increasingly wide array of acts, ranging from alternative icons BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rk and M.I.A. to MOR pop/rockers the Fray and Ashlee Simpson.\n\n\n-------[Discography]----------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist: Timbaland\nGenre: Hip-Hop/Rap\nStudio Albums:\nShock Value (Double Disc Version) (2007)\nShock Value II (2009)\n\n\n\n-------[Group Notes]----------------------------------------------------------\n\nEnjoy this 320 kbps iTunes Edition!\nAlso included are digital booklets\n\n\n-------[Screenshots]-------------------------------------------------------------\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pix2links.com/image/dOMwW.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pix2links.com/image/dOMwW.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pix2links.com/image/12cEh.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pix2links.com/image/12cEh.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pix2links.com/image/KWD3c.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pix2links.com/image/KWD3c.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33067a1eced57e4147c5a4c7e5f9decfd115c73b","amp;dn":"Timbaland+%2B+Keri+Hilson+Discography+%28iTunes+Edition%29+%5BtheLEAK%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33067a1eced57e4147c5a4c7e5f9decfd115c73b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,6,122,30,206,213,126,65,71,197,164,199,229,249,222,207,209,21,199,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
