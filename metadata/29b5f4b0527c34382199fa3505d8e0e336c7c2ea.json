After suffering more than her share of abuse from her husband, Rolf (Michael Nyqvist), Elisabeth (Lisa Lindgren) takes her two children, Stefan (Sam Kessel) and Eva (Emma Samuelsson), to a commune run by her brother GÃƒÂ¶ran (Gustav Hammarsten). Life at the commune is crowded with people with laid-back attitudes towards sex, nudity, and recreational drug use, prompting plenty of political debate. GÃƒÂ¶ran's partner, Lena (Anja Lundkvist), is a particular proponent of free-spirited bed-hopping, something GÃƒÂ¶ran doesn't really like but tolerates. Lena duly gets involved with the rebellious Erik (Olle Sarri) and finds fulfillment in the form of her first orgasm, something that leads her to confess to GÃƒÂ¶ran that she was always faking it with him. Meanwhile, various dramas are at work amongst the other commune members, including the once-married Lasse (Ola Norell) and Anna (Jessica Liedberg) (who split up when Anna announced she was a lesbian) and Klas (Shanti Roney), whose advances to Lasse are continually rebuffed. The goings-on of the commune are observed and commented on by a pair of neighbors, Margit (Therese Brunnander) and Ragner (Claes Hartelius), whose marriage is so lackluster that Ragner masturbates compulsively. Their son, the fat and miserable Fredrik (Henrik LundstrÃƒÂ¶m), befriends Elisabeth's daughter, Eva, who longs to have a family again. When Rolf appears on the scene seeking reconciliation, it seems Eva may get her wish.\n\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / Spanish / Dutch","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29b5f4b0527c34382199fa3505d8e0e336c7c2ea","amp;dn":"Tillsammans+aka+Together+2000+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29b5f4b0527c34382199fa3505d8e0e336c7c2ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,181,244,176,82,124,52,56,33,153,250,53,5,216,224,227,54,199,194,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
