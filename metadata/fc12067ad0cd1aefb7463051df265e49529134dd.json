This overview of human history, with 450 maps and 160 illustrations, begins with the emergence of Homo sapiens and culminates with the post-WWII era, moving among various regions of the globe in chronological order. It's divided into sections on ancient, medieval, early modern, Enlightenment and 20th century history, with easy-to-read two-page entries covering such subjects as &quot;Barbarian Invasions of the Roman Empire, 100-500&quot; and &quot;The Development of Australia and New Zealand Since 1790.&quot; \n\nThe section on postwar life includes charts showing migration patterns, female enfranchisement, distribution of wealth across the globe and changes in the environment. O'Brien, a professor at the London School of Economics, has done a fine job editing this concise edition, an excellent gift book for students of history.................................\n\n[/color][/code][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc12067ad0cd1aefb7463051df265e49529134dd","amp;dn":"Atlas+of+World+History%3A+Concise+Edition-MANTESH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc12067ad0cd1aefb7463051df265e49529134dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,18,6,122,208,205,26,239,183,70,48,81,223,38,94,73,82,145,52,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
