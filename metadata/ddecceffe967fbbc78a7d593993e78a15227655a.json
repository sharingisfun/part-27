Axis and Allied pilots turned the skies over Europe and the Pacific into one of history's bloodiest arenas. THE WARPLANES OF WWII provides a bird's eye view of the action, thanks to rare newsreel footage, some of which has never been seen in 60 years. You will bear witness to the German Blitzkrieg in Poland and France, along with RAF's heroic stand against the Luftwaffe during the Battle of Britain. The series also dramatizes what modern air squadrons could do to traditional ground and sea forcesÃ¢â‚¬â€from the Japanese Imperial NavyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surprise attack on Pearl Harbor to the daring daylight bombing raids of the US Air Forces over Europe. Later, of course, American delivered the horrifying atomic payloads upon Hiroshima and Nagasaki that brought the war to a close. This 10-cd set covers these aspects of the conflict, providing the most fascinating and complete look at the struggle for sky born supremacy ever assembled.
