The average Flash developer doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have luxurious timelines, employers who understand the value of reusability, or the help of an information architect to design a usable experience. This book helps bridge the gap for these coders who may be used to C++, Java, or C# and want to move over to Flash. Griffith covers real-world scenarios pulled from his own experiences developing games for over 8 years in the industry.\n\nGifts from GriffithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s REAL-WORLD experiences include: Game design templates and pre-written scripts to automate tasks within Flash; Classes for handling common math computations used in gaming, so that game developers can see how to set up a simple game flow; Powerful debugging tools for your games(debuggers for Flash games are hard to come by, and this book provides them for you).\n\nThe associated web site offers: Code from the game examples in the book with fully build-able source files. Additional code snippets, classes, and utilities. Scripts for automating tedious and repetitive tasks within Flash. Template game-design documents for planning game proposals in the same manner outlined in the book. Links to other helpful online resources for both Flash and game development.\n\n*Teaches Flash users the most effective ways to leverage Flash as a game development tool. Concrete, relatable approaches to Flash game development.\n\n* Provides sound strategies, and realistic goals for success ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ with REAL-WORLD examples and code included so that programmers become quickly empowered to make their own Flash games.\n\n*Covers ALL the aspects that come into play when developing a game in Flash, including art, animation, scripting, and optimization.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f977b2c56ce04ce80b45bd0bb1385eec7529cbd7","amp;dn":"Real-World+Flash+Game+Development+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f977b2c56ce04ce80b45bd0bb1385eec7529cbd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,119,178,197,108,224,76,232,11,69,189,11,177,56,94,236,117,41,203,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
