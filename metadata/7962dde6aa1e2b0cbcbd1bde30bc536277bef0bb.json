The program has also been translated into Hindi set to similar orchestration and is broadcast at the same time for a pan-Indian audience. This programme, which began in 1932, is aired every year at day-break on Mahalaya even till today. The programme, which started off as a live-performance has been broadcast in its pre-recorded format since the late nineteen-sixties. However, its great popularity remains undiminished even till today.\n\nThis program has almost become synonymous with Mahalaya called Debipakhsha. For nearly six decades from 1930 now, the whole of Bengal rises up in the chilly pre dawn hours, 4 am at morning to be precise, of the Mahalaya day to tune in to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mahisasura MardiniÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ broadcast.\n\nBirendra Krishna Bhadra who will always be remembered for making Mahalaya memorable to one and all is Birendra Krishna Bhadra, the magical voice behind the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mahisasura Mardini.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The legendary narrator recites the holy verses and tells the story of the descent of Durga to earth, in his inimitable style.It was on the day of Mahalaya,the beginning of &quot;devipaksha&quot;,the Gods and Goddesses woke up to prepare themselves for Durga Puja. Akashvani Mahalaya: In the year 1930, Mahalaya was first broadcasted over the radio in Akashvani. The programme was organised by Premankur Aatorthi, Birendra Krishna Bhadra, Nripendra Krishna Mukhopadhya and Raichand Boral. It was broadcasted live then. Later it was recorded and played.\n\nBhadra died long ago, but his recorded voice still forms the core of the Mahalaya program. In a sonorous, reverberating voice Birendra Bhadra renders the Mahalaya recital for two thrilling hours, mesmerizing every household with the divine aura of his narration, as the Bengalis submerge their souls in quiet moments of prayer.\n\nIn the year 1930, Mahalaya was first broadcasted over the radio in Akashvani. The programme was organised by Premankur Aatorthi, Birendra Krishna Bhadra, Nripendra Krishna Mukhopadhya and Raichand Boral. It was broadcasted live then. Later it was recorded and played. Bengal's cine star, Uttam Kumar had once recited Mahalaya while Hemanta Kumar Mukhopadhya was the music director. But it was not popular among the mass and from then it has always been the voice of Birendra Kishna Bhadra  enthralling the listeners in the pre-dawn hours of Mahalaya. \n\nMahisasura Mardini is a remarkable piece of audio drama matchless in Indian culture. Though the theme is mythical and the mantras Vedic, this program is a landmark composition. It's scripted by Bani Kumar, and narrated by Bhadra while Dijen Mukhopadhya, Manobendra Mukhopadhya (Tabo Achinta....), Sandhya Mukhopadhya, Arati Mukhopadhya, Utpala Sen, Shyamal Mitra and Supriti Ghosh (Bajlo tomar alor benu) sang in their melodious voices. The enchanting music is composed by none other than the immortal Pankaj Mullick[8], and the songs are rendered by famous singers of yesteryears, including Hemant Kumar and Arati Mukherjee. As the recital begins, the serene morning air resonates with the long drawn sound of the sacred conch shell, immediately followed by a chorus of invocation, melodiously setting the stage for the recitation of the Chandi Mantra.\n.\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 655 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 112kb/s VBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: Bengali/Sanskrit\nRunTime: 1:31:43\nSubtitles: English (Hard Coded)\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]   \nDuration: 1:31:43","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7962dde6aa1e2b0cbcbd1bde30bc536277bef0bb","amp;dn":"Mahisasuramardini+-+Chandi+Path_Mahalaya+-+Bengali+Puja+-+Xvid+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7962dde6aa1e2b0cbcbd1bde30bc536277bef0bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,98,221,230,170,30,43,12,188,189,27,222,48,188,83,98,119,190,240,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
