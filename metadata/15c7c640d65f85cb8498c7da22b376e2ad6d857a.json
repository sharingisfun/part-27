The production is very thin, and now ain't the time to lament Wendy James shortcomings as a singer, but Pete Thomas is on hand to hold things together. A bit of a curiosity and collector's item in the careers of James and Costello both, but not just for completists. The opening number, all two minutes of it, is some kind of pop gem in miniature all by itself. And it only gets better.\n\nSeed or suck eggs :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15c7c640d65f85cb8498c7da22b376e2ad6d857a","amp;dn":"Wendy+James+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+Now+Ain%5C%27t+the+Time+for+Your+Tears","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15c7c640d65f85cb8498c7da22b376e2ad6d857a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,199,198,64,214,95,133,203,132,152,199,218,34,179,118,226,173,109,133,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
