(Once upon a time theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d even have been described as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“baggyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.)\n \nBut AlbarnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s alter ego seems to allow him to shake off concepts of indie credibility that he may otherwise have clung to, aiming instead for the pop jugular with the simple melodies of Feel Good Inc and Clint Eastwood, whose loping gait does nothing to diminish that chorus: \n&quot;IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got sunshine in a bag&quot;, a sly reference to the actorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s classic The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (also the inspiration for the name of another Albarn side project, The Good, the Bad \n&amp; the Queen).\n\nEastwoodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s there again on the brilliant Dirty Harry, another shuffling beat underpinning an uplifting childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s choir until Bootie Brown takes the mike. \n\nAlbarnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s social conscience is also in evidence here, the kids singing &quot;I need a gun to keep myself from harm&quot;, an idea echoed (obviously) in Kids With Guns. 2010ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Plastic Beach birthed four further singles, but they made less of an impact, despite the fact that they see Albarn pursue a more commercially pop route: \n\nSuperfast Jellyfish demonstrates an attractive lightness of touch, while On Melancholy Hill reflects its name perfectly, Albarn sounding glum over a candyfloss minor-key pop classic that deserved to peak far higher than 78 in the British charts.\n\nSadly thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nothing here from their iPad album, The Fall, and instead weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re given the sped-up, somewhat disorientating Ed Case/Sweet Irie version of Clint Eastwood. But that fails to distract from the fact that Albarn has, against the odds, proven himself to be one of the most inventive of the UKÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s high-profile musicians over the past two decades. \n\nAdmire the riches this national treasure has bestowed upon us. \n\nThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s plenty to smile about, though Gorillaz remain no laughing matter.\n__________\n\n 1.
