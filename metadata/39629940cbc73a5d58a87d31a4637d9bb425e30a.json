He had a pitch-perfect voice and footwork that his idol Fred Astaire admired. Who will ever forget the Moonwalk? Kids today who only know Jackson through video performances are nevertheless fascinated by him. Megan Stine provides a sensitive, fair-minded depiction of this unique music legend.\r\n\r\nWho Was Michael Jackson?\r\nEnglish | 2015 | ISBN: 0448484102 | 112 pages | ePUB | 25.65 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39629940cbc73a5d58a87d31a4637d9bb425e30a","amp;dn":"Who+Was+Michael+Jackson%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39629940cbc73a5d58a87d31a4637d9bb425e30a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,98,153,64,203,199,58,93,88,168,125,49,164,99,125,155,180,37,227,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
