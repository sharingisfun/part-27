Funny stuff, I love it. If you watch this and enjoy it, and you have a job and/or money, you would be doing yourself and the world at large a favor by going to www.rifftrax.com and purchasing the license for the commentary for a mere $2.99. If they sell well they will continue to be made.\n\nThere is no way to turn the commentary off and just watch the movie. I can\\&amp;#039;t see why you would want to though. Any fan of Star Trek or Mystery Science Theater 3000 or both should give this a try.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa2ceae46c80796790ea7ef83ec608df4b82da36","amp;dn":"Rifftrax+-+Star+Trek+Generations+%28Commentary+by+Mike+Nelson+and+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa2ceae46c80796790ea7ef83ec608df4b82da36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,44,234,228,108,128,121,103,144,234,126,248,62,198,8,223,75,130,218,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
