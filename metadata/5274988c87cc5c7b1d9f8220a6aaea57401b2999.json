A self-proclaimed &quot;neurotic Jew,&quot; he has a wife who wants things he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t give her, an agent who wants a book he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t deliver, and dead parents who, well, they don't really want anything, but that doesn't stop the memory of them from haunting Yuvi at every opportunity.\n\nHis life begins to unravel as quickly as his unfinished novel, until the two finally begin to intertwine. Soon, his real-life friends and family begin to intermix with his characters.\n\nYuvi travels from his suburban-Atlanta home to the North Carolina mountains of his father's childhood, to several hospital waiting rooms in a struggle to save himself, his marriage, his novel, and also the life of his brother-in-law and end war in the Middle East (if he has time).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5274988c87cc5c7b1d9f8220a6aaea57401b2999","amp;dn":"Yuvi+Zalkow+-+A+Brilliant+Novel+in+the+Works+%28retail%29.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5274988c87cc5c7b1d9f8220a6aaea57401b2999","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,116,152,140,135,204,92,123,29,159,130,32,166,170,234,87,64,27,41,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
