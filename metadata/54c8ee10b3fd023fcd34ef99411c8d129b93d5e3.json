Mount and Install MageSlayer.\n2. Apply the 1.1 update to patch the game to the latest version. (browse for mage.VPK)\n\n\nHOW TO ENABLE IN-GAME MIDI MUSIC?\n\n\nOptions&gt;Audio&gt;Turn MIDI ON\n\n\nNOTE\n\n\nUnfortunately the only way to get the awesome non MIDI music is to run the game on Windows 95/98 and probably burn the image to a disc instead of mounting it(you'll probably have to make a new image in test mode with ImgBurn if you want to burn MageSlayer on a disc)\n\n\nWorks on Windows XP\n\n\nI don't know if MageSlayer works on Win 7 or 8 so please don't ask me. If you really like this game then download it and try it. If it doesn't work on newer operating systems then you can only play it in a virtual machine running Windows 95/98 or XP.\n\n\nEnjoy &amp; Please Seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54c8ee10b3fd023fcd34ef99411c8d129b93d5e3","amp;dn":"MageSlayer+%5BPC%5D+%5BENGLISH%5D+%5BFULL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54c8ee10b3fd023fcd34ef99411c8d129b93d5e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,200,238,16,179,253,2,63,205,52,239,153,65,28,141,18,155,147,213,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
