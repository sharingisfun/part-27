The 12:51 version of &quot;SITTIN' IN THE DARK&quot;\nbecomes especially popular in clubs and on radio (and still\ngets much airplay there today).\n\n&quot;MAS HYSTERIA&quot; eventually sells over 250,000 copies, ironically\nmaking it Carolyne's biggest-selling record anywhere. Because\nit is sold at a &quot;nice price,&quot; she is ineligible for the\naccolades that a Gold Record would normally bring. She will\nalso never see a penny from this record, her biggest success.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d93fb5e70d615d5b6d6961075821c283db01bdb","amp;dn":"Carolyne+Mas+-+Mas+Hysteria+%281980%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d93fb5e70d615d5b6d6961075821c283db01bdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,147,251,94,112,214,21,213,182,214,150,16,117,130,28,40,61,176,27,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
