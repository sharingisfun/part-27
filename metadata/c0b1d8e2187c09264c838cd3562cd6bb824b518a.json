Scott Fitzgerald's famous dictum &quot;There are no second acts in American lives.&quot; The pixieish singer had a few hits after her late mid-1980s domination of the country's popular imagination, and has continued to release fine, mature pop albums all along. Yet her public image is so frozen in stone as that &quot;unusual&quot; girl who sang &quot;Girls Just Wanna Have Fun&quot; and &quot;Time After Time&quot; that many people have never been able to entirely move past the old multicolored- hair thrift-shop-clothes image. Fully half of SHE'S SO UNUSUAL appears here, along with eight other hits, including the affecting &quot;True Colors&quot; and the yearning, sexy &quot;I Drove All Night,&quot; as well as should-have-been hits like the wistful, beautifully sung title track from Lauper's underrated 1991 album HAT FULL OF STARS. The fizzy new wave pop of &quot;Money Changes Everything&quot; and even the slight soundtrack entry &quot;The Goonies R Good Enough&quot; are as charming as ever, but it's the unfairly ignored later material that makes THE ESSENTIAL CYNDI LAUPER truly essential.\n(Source: cduniverse.com)\n\nGenre: Pop\nOriginal Year: 2003\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01.
