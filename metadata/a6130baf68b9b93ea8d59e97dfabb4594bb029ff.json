As they struggle to come to terms with life in the real world, we learn about the extraordinary lives they used to live - in houses with many mothers, where their sisters may be married off at 14 and, surprisingly, where no-one can wear red in case it offends the Second Coming. Powerfully emotional and compelling, a fascinating insight to a community it's hard to believe exists.\n\nDuration : 1:18:08\nVCodec : XviD (2pass)\nACodec : AC3 [2.0]\n\nPls help seed to keep torrent alive!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6130baf68b9b93ea8d59e97dfabb4594bb029ff","amp;dn":"BBC+Storyville+-+Leaving+the+Cult+XviD+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6130baf68b9b93ea8d59e97dfabb4594bb029ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,19,11,175,104,185,185,62,168,213,158,151,223,171,180,89,75,176,41,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
