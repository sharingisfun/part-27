It will locate Duplicate files on any drive! It will even find duplicate files that have different names based on content! The program will save a log file that you can open up as you go thru and move things around, rename them, delete one or the other, or whatever you have to do to whip your drive(s) into shape. This program helped me free up over 100Mb on my picture drive alone. Over 50Gb on my Music Drive and a whole bunch on my pirate drive as well.\n\n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\\n\nBe sure to check this little goodie out, it is free to distribute and up/down load with full credits to the author. Awesome!  I&amp;#039;d rate it a 6!\n\nHSJ\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cf219f5007ec5518dc7b909c12a48479e86c093","amp;dn":"DuplicateFileFinder.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cf219f5007ec5518dc7b909c12a48479e86c093","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,242,25,245,0,126,197,81,141,199,185,9,193,42,72,71,158,134,192,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
