The next year, they parted ways with Rosado, and started looking for a new vocalist, but ultimately decided that the best decision was for Machado to step up to vocals. El NiÃƒÂ±o then changed their name to Ill NiÃƒÂ±o, released an EP in 2000, and signed with Roadrunner Records shortly thereafter.\n\nIll NiÃƒÂ±o released their debut album, Revolution RevoluciÃƒÂ³n, on September 18, 2001. In support of the album's release, the band was part of the Ozzfest and JÃƒÂ¤germeister tours in 2002. The album's single, &quot;What Comes Around,&quot; received significant airplay on MTV2 and on the Active Rock charts. In early 2003, right before Ill NiÃƒÂ±o was set to record the follow-up to Revolution RevoluciÃƒÂ³n, Ill NiÃƒÂ±o parted ways with guitarist Marc Rizzo and percussionist Roger Vasquez. Rizzo stayed aboard long enough to record some of the guitars for the new album, and then the band hired percussionist Danny Couto to replace Roger Vasquez. Shortly before the release of Confession, the band also hired Ahrue Luster, formerly of Machine Head, to fill the vacant guitar spot.\n\nIn March 2010, the band announced that they had inked a deal with Victory Records, would be in the studio in April, and that the album would be produced by Dave Chavarri, Cristian Machado, Laz Pina, and Ahrue Luster. Co-Production would come from Sahaj Ticotin (RA) and Clint Lowery of Sevendust. On June 2, 2010, Ill NiÃƒÂ±o released a brand new track, &quot;Scarred (My Prison)&quot;, from their Dead New World album.\n\nDead New World was released on October 25, 2010. The band toured Australia in February and March, 2011 as part of the Soundwave Festival.\n\nIn February 2012 Ill NiÃƒÂ±o announced that they are preparing to enter the studio to begin laying down its sixth full-length album for a summer release via Victory Records. The recording sessions will begin next month in Hoboken, New Jersey; Austin, Texas; and Denver, Colorado.\n\nIll NiÃƒÂ±o frontman Cristian Machado commented: &quot;It's 2012 and we're all still alive. It's time to redefine Latin metal.&quot;\n\nIll NiÃƒÂ±o drummer/founder Dave Chavarri added: &quot;This time around, we want to explore Latin and tribal rhythms we have never explored in the past five releases, giving us no musical boundaries at all.&quot;\n\nIll Nino's 6th full-length studio album, &quot;Epidemia&quot;, is slated for an October 22nd release on Victory Records. Upon unveiling the album artwork, a YouTube clip was posted, previewing a new song, titled &quot;The Depression&quot; off the new CD.\n\n'Til Death, La Familia' is the seventh studio album, released by American heavy metal band Ill Nino. The album will be released on July 22, 2014, through Victory Records.\n01. Live Like There's No Tomorrow (4:23)\n02. Not Alive In My Nightmare (4:25)\n03. I'm Not The Enemy (3:31)\n04.
