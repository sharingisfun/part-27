The complete Stern/Byrne run, culminating with the standard-setting version of Cap's awe-inspiring origin! Collects Captain America #247-255.&quot;\n\nThere is no date credit on the file itself but I have listed 2007 as the date because that was the the most common printing of the paperback edition. The original stories were written in 1990. Thanks to Bchry-DCP for this fantastic new HR scan. Please seed, and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3afd791709f5fc958debf8aac4a55f37e78dafe8","amp;dn":"Captain+America+-+War+%26amp%3B+Remembrance+TPB+%282007%29+%28Bchry-DCP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3afd791709f5fc958debf8aac4a55f37e78dafe8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,253,121,23,9,245,252,149,141,235,248,170,196,165,95,55,231,141,175,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
