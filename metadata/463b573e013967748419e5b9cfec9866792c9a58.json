All these tracks were recorded and mixed for mono, and there were never any true stereo versions.\n\nThese MP3s were ripped from the Polydor cassette played on a low end shelf system. Expect mediocre sound quality and some tape hiss.\n\nThe tracks are:\n\nWhen I Was Young\nA Girl Called Sandoz\nDon't Bring Me Down\nShe'll Return It\nSee See Rider\nThe Other Side of This Life\nHey Gyp\nHelp Me, Girl\nThat Ain't Where It's At\nYou're On My Mind\nInside Looking Out\nCheating\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:463b573e013967748419e5b9cfec9866792c9a58","amp;dn":"Best+of+Eric+Burdon+and+the+Animals+vol.+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"463b573e013967748419e5b9cfec9866792c9a58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,59,87,62,1,57,103,116,132,25,229,185,207,236,152,102,121,44,154,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
