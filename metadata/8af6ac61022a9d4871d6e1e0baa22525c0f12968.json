Created by album and book cover designer Dean Motter, it was developed for a year in close collaboration with comic artist and illustrator Paul Rivoche, whose series of poster illustrations stirred up great interest in the project. The series is notable for publishing early work by comic artists who would later emerge as important alternative cartoonists, including Jaime Hernandez, Gilbert Hernandez, Mario Hernandez, Seth, Shane Oakley and D'Israeli.\n\nThe first four issues were written and illustrated by Jaime and Gilbert Hernandez, with additional writing by Mario Hernandez. The Hernandez brothers quit over payment delays from Vortex. Issues 5 through 14 of the series were then written by Motter, with issues 6 through 13 illustrated by Seth.\n\nSet in Radiant City, a dystopian municipality influenced by Bauhaus and Fritz Lang's Metropolis, the series concerns a mysterious figure who purports to be its architect. His radical theories of &quot;psychetecture&quot; cause the citizenry to go mad, just as he did, and he takes on the mission to repair his creation.\n\nTo accomplish this he remains awake twenty-four hours a day by means of the drug &quot;insomnalin,&quot; all the while coping with a Dick TracyÃ¢â‚¬â€œlike rogues gallery and supporting cast including his long-suffering ex-girlfriend Mercedes.\n\nMister X's influence can be seen and was acknowledged in films like Terry Gilliam's Brazil, Tim Burton's Batman, and Alex Proyas' Dark City.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8af6ac61022a9d4871d6e1e0baa22525c0f12968","amp;dn":"Mister+X+Vol+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8af6ac61022a9d4871d6e1e0baa22525c0f12968","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,246,172,97,2,42,157,72,113,214,225,224,186,162,37,37,192,241,41,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
