However taking into account the strong interaction between the pump and the pumping installation, the need to control the operation, the requirement to operate at best efficiency in order to save energy, the provision to improve the operation against cavitation and other more specific but very interesting and important topics, the object of a book on centrifugal pumps must cover a large field. The present book examines a number of these more specific topics, beyond the contents of a textbook, treating not only the pump's design and operation but also strategies to increase energy efficiency, the fluid flow control, the fault diagnosis","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fabc3fe1fbf2e32dacc8d260426c7c72ef6dc20","amp;dn":"Centrifugal+Pumps+-+Dimitris+Papantonis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fabc3fe1fbf2e32dacc8d260426c7c72ef6dc20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,171,195,254,31,191,46,50,218,204,141,38,4,38,199,199,46,246,220,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
