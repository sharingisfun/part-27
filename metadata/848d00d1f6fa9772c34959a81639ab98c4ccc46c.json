His life's crowning achievement, his greatest film, would have told the story of a European village as the last hour of 999 A.D. approached -- the midnight that the villagers were convinced would bring with it Armageddon. Now that story will never be told. But he's still working it out in his head, making a film that no one will ever see. No one but us.\n\nSignal to Noise is a poignant story, rich in humanity, depth, and communications theory. A beautifully designed and printed book, showcasing McKean's stunning artwork and Gaiman's story, Signal to Noise will make you re-evaluate your thinking about the potential of the medium and a book you will be proud to share with your friends. They will thank you for it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:848d00d1f6fa9772c34959a81639ab98c4ccc46c","amp;dn":"Neil_Gaiman_%26amp%3B_Dave_McKean_-_Signal_to_Noise_%28digital%29_%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"848d00d1f6fa9772c34959a81639ab98c4ccc46c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,141,0,209,246,250,151,114,195,73,89,168,22,57,171,152,196,204,196,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
