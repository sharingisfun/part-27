Carlos (drums, percussion).\nCheap Trick created a substantial fan base through its own brand of power pop music with a hard-edged yet melodic pop sound that combines the tunefulness of The Beatles with the speed and energy of punk rock.  The Los Angeles Times has remarked that &quot;Cheap Trick gained fame by twisting the Beatlesque into something shinier, harder, more American.&quot; Their biggest hits include &quot;Surrender&quot;, &quot;I Want You to Want Me&quot;, &quot;Dream Police&quot;, and &quot;The Flame.&quot; Cheap Trick also performed a cover version of Big Star's &quot;In the Street&quot; as the theme song for That '70s Show from the second season onward and the theme song &quot;Baby Muggles&quot; for The Colbert Report. \nCheap Trick continues to tour with the original lineup, and their most recent release, Rockford, has gained critical acclaim.  The band is most popular in Japan, where they have remained popular superstars since their first album. They have been often referred to in the Japanese press as the &quot;American Beatles&quot;. The Illinois State Senate has declared April 1st to be &quot;Cheap Trick Day&quot; in the State. The band was also ranked #25 in VH1's list of the 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c57ffc5f97ecec8e4c56728e1219725cdb90c22","amp;dn":"Cheap+Trick-The+Latest-2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c57ffc5f97ecec8e4c56728e1219725cdb90c22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,87,255,197,249,126,206,200,228,197,103,40,225,33,151,37,205,185,12,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
