Later, while attending a nightclub with her friend Simon Lewis (Robert Sheehan), Clary witnesses a bear being murdered by Jace Wayland (Jamie Campbell Bower), whom only Clary appears to see. Meanwhile, Jocelyn is abducted by two men, Emil Pangborn (Kevin Durand) and Samuel Blackwell (Robert Maillet), and leaves a message for Clary warning her that someone named Valentine is coming after her. Returning home, Clary is attacked by a demon and rescued by Jace, who reveals himself to be a Shadowhunter, a warrior trained to slay demons hidden on Earth, such as the man in the nightclub. Jocelyn was a Shadowhunter as well, and Clary has inherited her powers, including the ability to read runes.\n\nClary and Jace visit Clary's neighbor and friend, Madame Dorothea (C. C. H. Pounder), a witch who reveals that Pangborn and Blackwell are after the Mortal Cup, one of the three Mortal Instruments given to the first Shadowhunter by the Angel Raziel, that allows humans to become half-Angel. Simon, now able see Jace, joins them as they leave to meet Luke in his bookstore. There, Luke is being interrogated by Pangborn and Blackwell, and reveals that he is after the Mortal Cup himself. The trio then escapes to the Shadowhunters' base of operations, the Institute, where Clary and Simon meet Jace's fellow Shadowhunters, Alec Lightwood (Kevin Zegers) and Isabelle Lightwood (Jemima West), and their leader, Hodge Starkweather (Jared Harris), who reveals that Pangborn and Blackwell are working for Valentine Morgenstern (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a ex-Shadowhunter who betrayed the group and sought to steal the Mortal Cup for himself in order to gain control of Shadowhunters and demons alike.\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b77234904cb64f7db3942b807d9fc4b7352aad7a","amp;dn":"The+Mortal+Instruments+City+of+Bones.flv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b77234904cb64f7db3942b807d9fc4b7352aad7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,114,52,144,76,182,79,125,179,148,43,128,125,159,196,183,53,42,173,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
