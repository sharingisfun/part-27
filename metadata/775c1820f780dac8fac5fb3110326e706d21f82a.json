They are joined by two Italian\nimprovisers, Alberto Braida on piano and Fabrizio Spera on drums. As with many\nfree improvisation, forget about roles in the band: all musicians contribute in\nequal parts, adding sounds, interacting and creating high levels of immediate\nintensity. The band's name is well chosen, as the music is somewhere suspended\nin the air, very sparse and devoid of a need to produce sound, free of earthly\nconcerns, although it flows quite organically, naturally, without structure or\nfoundation. The musicians play their limited notes and sounds with reserve,\npaying full attention to each of them, infusing every one of them with\npower. Braida can play a few keys, just enough to add to the overall\natmosphere, without feeling the need to make chords, or phrases. It's the sound\nthat counts, and in that he finds a real soulmate in John Butcher, whose\ncareful powerful minimalism is impressive as usual, Edwards' versatility and\ncreativity, both on arco and plucked is astonishing, and listen how Spera\nbuilds depth, contrast and color. Some moments are harsh, others are of an\nincredible subtlety and nuance. The end result is one of ethereal beauty, not\neasy to get into, but worth every note.\n\n--\n\nby Massimo Ricci &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://touchingextremes.wordpress.com/2011/05/18/weightless-%E2%80%93-a-brush-with-dignity/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://touchingextremes.wordpress.com/2011/05/18/weightless-%E2%80%93-a-brush-with-dignity/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nby Mark Corroto &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=34444&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=34444&lt;/a&gt;\n\ndi Enrico Bettinello (it) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://italia.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=4725&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://italia.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=4725&lt;/a&gt;\n\npor Pachi Tapiz (es) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tomajazz.com/web/?p=2988&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tomajazz.com/web/?p=2988&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:775c1820f780dac8fac5fb3110326e706d21f82a","amp;dn":"Weightless+-+A+Brush+With+Dignity+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"775c1820f780dac8fac5fb3110326e706d21f82a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,92,24,32,247,128,218,200,250,197,251,49,16,50,110,112,109,33,248,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
