The young couple try their best to lead a normal life surrounded by talking locusts, blood rain showers, and pot-smoking wraiths. But when the Anti-Christ (Robinson) makes his home base in their neighborhood, Lindsey finds herself the object of his affection. With the help of her family, friends, and a lawn-mowing zombie neighbor, the young couple set off to stop the Anti-Christ from taking her as his bride... and just maybe, saving the world in the process.\n\n\n\nContainer: MKV File   (remember webrib)\n\nSubs: Realuploads2 \n\nTestet: WinRaR Extract to\n\n\nRemember to seed so others can get the same enjoyment of the movie that you've got.\nKeep in mind I can not give full speed to all, so if you're one of the lucky ones, help seed.\n\nAnd remember, because I upload in winRAR files, it does not mean that it is &quot;VIRUS&quot;.\n\nPress my name &quot;Realuploads&quot; and see my other uploads before you write crap.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you use RssReader then copy this to &quot;My feeds&quot;: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/acb357ddd9a0e1461108ab0ca9c1f5cb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/acb357ddd9a0e1461108ab0ca9c1f5cb&lt;/a&gt; \n(copy the link)\n\nand you will see my uploads when it comes on the page.\n\nOr\n\nIf you want to download immediately when they are uploaded, go into uTorrent and add feeds and make settings to download.\n\n \n\nGroup Realuploads \n\n\n\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec307bcbc575890f7881044ecfd54caaf3552fb4","amp;dn":"Rapture-Palooza+%28+Dk+subs+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec307bcbc575890f7881044ecfd54caaf3552fb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,48,123,203,197,117,137,15,120,129,4,78,207,213,76,170,243,85,47,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
