Hired to answer user questions such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“What is a poke?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Why canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t I access my ex-girlfriendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s profile?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ her early days at the company were characterized by a sense of camaraderie, promise, and ambition: Here was a group of scrappy young upstarts on a mission to rock Silicon Valley and change the world.\n\nOver time, this sense of mission became so intense that working forfelt like more than just a job; it implied a wholehearted dedication to Ã¢â‚¬Å“the cause.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Employees were incentivized to live within one mile of the office, summers were spent carousing at the company pool house, and female employees were told to wear T-shirts with founder Mark ZuckerbergÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s profile picture on his birthday. Losse started to wonder what this new medium meant for real-life relationships: Wouldimprove our social interactions? Or would we all just adapt our behavior to the habits and rules of these brilliant but socially awkward Internet savants who have become todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s youngest power players? Increasingly skeptical, Losse graduated from customer service to the internationalization teamÃ¢â‚¬â€tasked with rolling outto the rest of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â€ finally landing a seat right outside ZuckerbergÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s office as his personal ghostwriter, the voice of the boy king.
