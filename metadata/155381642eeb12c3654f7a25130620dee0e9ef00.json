The song reached number two on the US Billboard Charts in 1988. The video features a combination of color and black-and-white shots in the same frames. It was directed by Diane Keaton. The song was recently covered by Jordan McCoy.\n\nBelinda Carlisle (born August 17, 1958 in Hollywood, California) is an American singer and the lead vocalist and founding member of all-female new wave band The Go-Go's.\n\nThe first release from Heaven on Earth was &quot;Heaven Is a Place on Earth&quot;, which topped the single charts, not only in the U.S., but also in the UK and in several other countries (the dance mix of the song also topped the dance chart). The radio-ready song was further propelled by a video, directed by Academy Award-winning American actress Diane Keaton. The second single from the album was &quot;I Get Weak&quot;, which shot to #2 in the U.S. and #10 in the U.K. The song was written by Diane Warren. The third single from the album was &quot;Circle in the Sand,&quot; another Top 10 hit in the U.S., the UK, and Germany. &quot;World Without You&quot; was another British hit, followed by 1988 low-charting ballad &quot;Love Never Dies&quot;, making this her fifth single from the album in the UK. In the U.S., the fourth and last single, &quot;I Feel Free,&quot; a cover of the Cream classic, failed to reach the Top 40.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:155381642eeb12c3654f7a25130620dee0e9ef00","amp;dn":"Belinda+Carlisle+-+I+Get+Weak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"155381642eeb12c3654f7a25130620dee0e9ef00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,83,129,100,46,235,18,195,101,79,122,37,19,6,32,222,224,233,239,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
