As of late, certain inferior sailing boats have discovered \nflaws in Brink (brinkthegame.com), thinking themselves exciting and new.\n\nToo late. The Lulz Boat controls this ocean, chumps.\n\nSome weeks ago, we smashed into Brink with our heavy artillery Lulz \nCannons and decided to switch to ninja mode. From our LFI entry point, \nwe acquired command execution via local file inclusion of enemy fleet \nApache vessel. We then found that the HTTPD had SSH auth keys, which \nlet our ship SSH into other servers. See where this is going?\n\nWe then switched to root ammunition rounds. \nAnd we rooted... and rooted... and rooted...\n\nAfter mapping their internal network and thoroughly pillaging all of \ntheir servers, we grabbed all their source code and database passwords, \nwhich we proceeded to shift silently back to our storage deck.\n\nPlease find enclosed everything we took, excluding one thing -\n200,000+ Brink users. We actually like this company and would\nlike for them to speed up the production of Skyrim, so we'll\ngive them one less thing to worry about. You're welcome! :D\n\nPlease keep making awesome games, guys, and you should\ntotally add an official LulzSec top hat to new releases.\n\nBut anyway, bwahahaha... &gt;:]\n\n--------------------\n\nSee also:\nSenate.gov internal data - lulzsecurity.com/releases/senate.gov.txt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30343f9ded6c50f38c80e21b7571fbc3d675999d","amp;dn":"Bethesda+internal+data","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30343f9ded6c50f38c80e21b7571fbc3d675999d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,52,63,157,237,108,80,243,140,128,226,27,117,113,251,195,214,117,153,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
