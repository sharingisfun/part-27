But Kai Ã¢â‚¬Å“MaceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Mason broke up with her and the loss of him rocked her world. One night, Stella gets a call, late (again), from one of the members of her crazy band. She has to go play clean up (again) and runs into Mace (and a shed load of police) and ends up getting shot. Mace finds he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like it much that his ex-girlfriend got shot right in front of him, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worse. A very bad man has thrown down the gauntlet, and all the Rock Chicks are in the firing line. Stella doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want Mace to be the one to keep her alive, but she has no choice. Mainly because Mace isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t giving her one.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7635b24e530af1f8dfafafe0e17ce7b9d4af1745","amp;dn":"Kristen+Ashley+-+Rock+Chick+06+-+Rock+Chick+Reckoning","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7635b24e530af1f8dfafafe0e17ce7b9d4af1745","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,53,178,78,83,10,241,248,223,175,175,224,225,124,231,185,212,175,23,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
