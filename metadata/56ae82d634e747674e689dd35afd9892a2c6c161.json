The end times are nearer than you think and this movie portrays one example of how it may all unfold. \n\nWith the Middle East in turmoil, Israel's preeminent Ally is thrust into an impending war... America is now the target as the battle for Jerusalem begins. Adapted from the Best Selling Book by Pastor John Hagee, Jerusalem Countdown highlights the reality of an inevitable conflict between Israel and Islam. When nuclear weapons are smuggled into America, Senior FBI Agent, Shane Daughtry is faced with an impossible task - find them before they are detonated. The clock is ticking and the only people who can help are a washed up arms dealer (Lee Majors), a retired Agent (Stacy Keach) and a by- the-book CIA Deputy Director played by Randy Travis. Nuclear holocaust on American soil threatens global stability and the impending destruction of the world is coming to fruition, in this film of international terror and suspense. \n\nThe prelude to Armageddon has begunÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nRuntime: 82 mins\nLanguage: English\nYear: 2012\nQuality: 10/10\nFormat: avi format \n\nSee reviews here,  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Jerusalem-Countdown-David-A-R-White/dp/B00720OO0S&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Jerusalem-Countdown-David-A-R-White/dp/B00720OO0S&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI would ask every Christian to do 2 things.\n\n1. If possible please buy this movie. Do you know that there are 2.2 billion Christians on earth today. But only a privileged few, around 12% have the means and the accessibility to buy Christian films. Many Christians are too poor to buy movies or live in places where Christian films are not available. \nThat's not all. Out of the 12% who have the means and accessibility to buy Christian media, only around 0.5% ever buys a Christian movie. In other words only 1 out of 200 Christians ever buys a Christian movie. Pathetic isn't it?\nPlease buy the movies to keep Christian films in business. And please do pray for the Christian movie makers and their families.\n\n2. Please seed the movies for as long as possible. If possible make copies and distribute to your poor neighbors. And please do pray for the movie makers and their families. Remember the Kingdom of Heaven is in you and so is the choice of Heaven/Hell. \n\nPS: If you need any specific Christian movie or have something to say then kindly send a mail to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;177e79737e7679747f657e64637e76792527272e576e767f7878397478397e79&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nKindly mention the subject as Christian Movies or something similar. \n\n&quot;Don't ask me what Christ can do for you! He has done all he could. Tell me what you can do for Christ?&quot;\n\nUploaded by Indian Christian\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56ae82d634e747674e689dd35afd9892a2c6c161","amp;dn":"Jerusalem+Countdown+%28Christian+Movie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56ae82d634e747674e689dd35afd9892a2c6c161","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,174,130,214,52,231,71,103,78,104,157,211,90,253,152,146,162,198,193,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
