Sometimes we just snuggle. (Bumper Sticker)\n\nMost girls might think twice before getting engaged to someone like Reyes Farrow - but Charley Davidson is not most girls. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a paranormal private eye and grim-reaper-in-training whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s known to be a bit of a hell-raiser, especially after a few shots of caffeine. Her beloved Reyes may be the only begotten son of evil, but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dark and sultry and deeply sexy and everything Charley could hope for. Really. But when the FBI file on ReyesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ childhood happens to land into her lap, she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help herself: She opens it...and then the real fun begins. First, Charley finds a naked corpse riding shotgun in her car. Then, a man loses his soul in a card game. Throw in a deaf boy who sees dead people, a woman running from mobsters, and a very suspicious Reyes, and things canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get any worse for Charley. Unless, of course, the 12 Beasts of Hell are unleashed.Ã¢â‚¬Â¦","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d639cba6efe28de5f3232ee4f7dd3713b8993634","amp;dn":"Darynda+Jones+-+Fifth+Grave+Past+the+Light+-+Charley+Davidson+5+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d639cba6efe28de5f3232ee4f7dd3713b8993634","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,57,203,166,239,226,141,229,243,35,46,228,247,221,55,19,184,153,54,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
