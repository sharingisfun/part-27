His repertoire incorporates cantatas written for soprano by composers like Handel, Bononcini, Carissimi, and Frescobaldi, and the repertoire of the old castrati. Marian has been called &quot;the Baroque nightingale&quot; by the renowned Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.\n\nMarian is an &quot;endocrinological castrato&quot; or &quot;natural castrato&quot;. A natural castrato is a singer who never went through puberty and so kept his &quot;unbroken&quot; voice intact.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:028f77fab5d827b7c2e3715c7d76ee7a621bf683","amp;dn":"Bononcini+-+Cantate+in+Soprano+-+Radu+Marian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"028f77fab5d827b7c2e3715c7d76ee7a621bf683","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,143,119,250,181,216,39,183,194,227,113,92,125,118,238,122,98,27,246,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
