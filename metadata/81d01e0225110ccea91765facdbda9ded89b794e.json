The sound quality is absolutely perfect in every respect. There are a few remarkable performances here, particularly Da-Doo-Run Run (Bob &amp; George duet), the Everly Brothers' classic All I Have To Do Is Dream, Song To Woody, and the Beatles' Yesterday (which is hard to believe he actually sang!) Overall, it's a very enjoyable way to spend an hour. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. Ghost Riders In The Sky\n02. Cupid\n03. All I Have To Do Is Dream\n04.
