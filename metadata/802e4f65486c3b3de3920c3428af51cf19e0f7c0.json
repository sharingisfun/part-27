You planned a meal and rice seemed to be the right starch to serve with it. You placed the saucepan on the stove, measured some water into it, pulled down the bag of rice, measured it into the cup, and poured it into the boiling water. As the water came back to a boil, on went the cover and, when the timer beeped, you ate the rice.\n\nThat was before we met the rice cooker. Since then, the world of riceÃ¢â‚¬â€the amazing array of rice available on every supermarket and specialty grocery shelf, where it grows, its lore and history, sharing recipes, the writing of this bookÃ¢â‚¬â€has become an everyday part of our lives.\n\nTo an American cook, the electric rice cooker has been, up to now, a take-it-or-leave- it kitchen appliance. I mean, whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a stove for? But to many Asian-American cooks and cooks throughout Asia, the rice cooker is an absolutely essential appliance for everyday meal preparation. It is the method of choice for cooking rice in Japanese and Chinese restaurants (most of the rice cooker manufacturers have a commercial division). Since in many of these diets rice is eaten three times a day, the rice cooker is always on in every home. There are even small ones with a handle to carry while traveling on vacations and business trips. Well, why eat less-than-perfect rice when you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:802e4f65486c3b3de3920c3428af51cf19e0f7c0","amp;dn":"The+Ultimate+Rice+Cooker+Cookbook+by+Beth+Hensperger+and+Julie+K","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"802e4f65486c3b3de3920c3428af51cf19e0f7c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,46,79,101,72,108,59,61,227,146,12,52,40,175,81,207,25,224,247,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
