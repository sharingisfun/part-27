A few of his best up-tempo tracks are represented (&quot;The Ghetto,&quot; his live cover of &quot;What&amp;#039;s Going On&quot;), but not before haunted material like &quot;I Love You More Than You&amp;#039;ll Ever Know,&quot; and &quot;Giving Up.&quot; Admittedly, his duets with Flack are among the best recordings of his career, ranging from the depressed (&quot;Where Is the Love&quot;) to the atmospheric (&quot;The Closer I Get to You&quot;) to the downright driving (&quot;Back Together Again&quot;). But A Donny Hathaway Collection neglects far too much material from his two greatest solo albums, 1970s Everything Is Everything and 1973&amp;#039;s Extension of a Man, to be considered the perfect first choice. It may simply be a matter of embellishing the myth of the tortured artist, but this doesn&amp;#039;t present both sides of the Hathaway legend. (AMG)\n\n\n\n\n01.
