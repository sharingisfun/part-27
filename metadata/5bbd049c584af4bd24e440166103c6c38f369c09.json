She is the author of more than twenty crime fiction novels set in England and several collections of short stories.\nHer witty, literate, and deftly plotted novels straddle the &quot;cozy&quot; and &quot;police procedural&quot; genres and are somewhat similar in flavor to those of Martha Grimes, Caroline Graham, M C Beaton, Margaret Yorke, and Pauline Bell.\n\nA brief synopsis of each novel can be found at the following link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/series/60320-sloan&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/series/60320-sloan&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAs far as I can tell, of the 23 titles in this series written so far, 8 have never been released in audio format.\nI am unable to find the following audio titles: His Burial Too (1973), Slight Mourning (1975), Some Die Eloquent (1979),\nLast Respects (1982), The Body Politic (1990), A Going Concern (1993), Injury Time (1994), After Effects (1996)\n\n\n01...
