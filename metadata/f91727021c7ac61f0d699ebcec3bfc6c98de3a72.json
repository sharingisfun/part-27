But when an artistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work lies in subverting normality, it can be difficult to raise well-adjusted children. Just ask Buster and Annie Fang. For as long as they can remember, they starred (unwillingly) in their parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ madcap pieces. But now that they are grown up, the chaos of their childhood has made it difficult to cope with life outside the fishbowl of their parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ strange world.\n\nWhen the lives theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve built come crashing down, brother and sister have nowhere to go but home, where they discover that Caleb and Camille are planning one last performance -Ã¢â‚¬â€œ their magnum opus -Ã¢â‚¬â€œ whether the kids agree to participate or not. Soon, ambition breeds conflict, bringing the Fangs to face the difficult decision about whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ultimately more important: their family or their art","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f91727021c7ac61f0d699ebcec3bfc6c98de3a72","amp;dn":"The+Family+Fang+by+Kevin+Wilson+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f91727021c7ac61f0d699ebcec3bfc6c98de3a72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,23,39,2,28,122,198,31,13,105,158,188,236,59,252,108,152,222,58,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
