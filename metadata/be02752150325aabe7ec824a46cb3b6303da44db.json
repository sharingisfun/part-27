Unquestionably the most nihilistic album to top the Billboard charts--and it&amp;#039;s doubtful that any will match it--Eyez also manages to dish out the good-times dance tunes and still flow seamlessly. Recording commenced within hours of Tupac Shakur&amp;#039;s release from prison, and a year&amp;#039;s worth of pent-up ideas are unleashed with a fury akin to lifting the lid on a box of plutonium. The line between high art and insufferable reality, possibilities and self-destruction, has never been so blurred. Eyez is a landmark achievement that is unlikely to be topped by any heir apparent to the hip-hop crown. --Gregg Turkington\n\n\nDisc: 1 \t\n1. Ambitionz Az A Ridah \t\n2. All Bout U \t\n3.
