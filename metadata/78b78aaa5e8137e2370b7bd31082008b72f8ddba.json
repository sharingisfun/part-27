In 1981, Smith wrote Gorky Park, which was called the &quot;thriller of the '80s&quot; by Time Magazine. It became a bestseller and won a Gold Dagger Award from the British Crime Writers' Association. \n\nFrom Recorded Books:\nIn this richly complex mystery, best-selling author Martin Cruz Smith paints a stunning backdrop of dazzling excesses and stark deprivation. Havana Bay portrays soulful Russian detective Arkady Renko exploring the dark side of Cuba as he investigates the fatal accident of a Soviet comrade. Still reeling from his wife\u001as untimely death in Moscow, Arkady flies to Cuba to identify an old colleague who has been pulled from Havana Bay. After he points out that the decaying corpse could be any missing person, police officials turn hostile. Suddenly, Arkady must emerge from his depression and uncover a web of corruption, or his new enemies will silence him forever. Martin Cruz Smith\u001as masterful prose transports you to Fidel\u001as fading paradise to search through crumbling buildings, hear riotous island music, and experience the intense tropical sun. The exotic, earthy characters burst from the pages with narrator Frank Muller\u001as dramatic performance.\n\n- AudioFile Earphones Award\n- A New York Times Notable Book of the Year\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78b78aaa5e8137e2370b7bd31082008b72f8ddba","amp;dn":"HAVANA+BAY+-+Martin+Cruz+Smith.+Read+by+Frank+Muller+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78b78aaa5e8137e2370b7bd31082008b72f8ddba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,183,138,170,94,129,55,226,55,11,123,211,16,130,0,139,114,248,221,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
