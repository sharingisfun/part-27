With the help of her new friends Ã¢â‚¬â€œ ice queen but heart of gold police inspector Natsuko Aki (Ichikawa) and the nattily attired journalist dude Seiji Hayami (Murakami) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Cutie sets out to save the world and maybe become a little more human in the process.\n\n&lt;img src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v441/jaevlamat/honey/cutie4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image hosted by Photobucket.com&quot;&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v441/jaevlamat/honey/cutie3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image hosted by Photobucket.com&quot;&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v441/jaevlamat/honey/cutie5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image hosted by Photobucket.com&quot;&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v441/jaevlamat/honey/cutie7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image hosted by Photobucket.com&quot;&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v441/jaevlamat/honey/cutie6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image hosted by Photobucket.com&quot;&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v441/jaevlamat/honey/cutie2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image hosted by Photobucket.com&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;i&gt;I have to go with the other posters. This was the most amazing and revolutionary action-adventure I have seen since &quot;Road Warrior&quot; way back when! Yes, maybe I sound like a nut after saying that, but the energy from the Fantasia Festival debut of this movie has convinced that I am not insane after all. &quot;Cutie Honey&quot; (the most unlikely action-film title I ever heard or could imagine) deserves to go down in film history as one of the greatest action-adventures of all time. For instance it's 10X better than the Lethal Weapon series, and Quentin Tarantino only wishes he had the talent to create a film like this (rather than steal it).\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI saw this film at the Fantasia Film Festival in Montreal, right after Blueberry. Holy smokes, this movie is totally awesome!!! Why can't north Americans make cool movies like this? It's super happy and action-packed, and it even makes fun of itself = it's perfect!!! For this vein of movies, Cutie Honey is the best I've ever seen!!!\n\nIf you have a vague idea what this movie is about, you'll be blown away by the extremes and humour presented on the screen. It's not serious. But a most excellent treat indeed!\n\nAll the acting is superficial, there's a constant(but not tumultuous) music track throughout, all the photography is extreme and the story itself is completely retarded. A lot of the humor comes from making fun of stupid little &quot;cutesy&quot; movies --&gt; also, the sexism is exaggerated too: Cutie Honey behaves in a ... &quot;special&quot; way: always innocently making sexy poses wearing only underwear, etc... All the action sequences are completely over the top, super loud, and mixed with cartoons as well.\n\nFor what it is, it's unbeatable.\n&lt;/i&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/b&gt; \n\n************************************************************\n\n\nAndra torrents/filmer jag lagt upp:\n\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://tracker.piratbyran.org/torrents-details.php?id=3295025&amp;hit=1&quot;&gt;Dead Friend [Korea 2004]&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thepiratebay.se/torrents-details.php?id=3298369&amp;hit=1&quot;&gt;Cutie Honey [Japan 2004]&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://tracker.piratbyran.org/torrents-details.php?id=3293234&amp;hit=1&quot;&gt;The Blue Light [Japan 2003]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://tracker.piratbyran.org/torrents-details.php?id=3304088&amp;hit=1&quot;&gt; Conduct Zero [Korea 2002]&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://tracker.piratbyran.org/torrents-details.php?id=3294535&amp;hit=1&quot;&gt; Barking Dogs Never Bite [Korea 2000]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://tracker.piratbyran.org/torrents-details.php?id=3307076&amp;hit=1&quot;&gt;Swing Girls [Japan 2004]&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://tracker.piratbyran.org/torrents-details.php?id=3309553&amp;hit=1&quot;&gt;Kids Return [Takeshi Kitano 1996]&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://tracker.piratbyran.org/torrents-details.php?id=3310096&amp;hit=1&quot;&gt;A  Scene at the Sea [Takeshi Kitano 1991]&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://tracker.piratbyran.org/torrents-details.php?id=3310493&amp;hit=1&quot;&gt;JDorama - [1998] Great Teacher Onizuka [JTV]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://tracker.piratbyran.org/torrents-details.php?id=3293442&amp;hit=1&quot;&gt;JDorama  - [2003] Waterboys + The Movie&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n************************************************************\n\nAsiantorrents","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55fad1b023d7a69492c98edb4bb3792e7a03b5fe","amp;dn":"Cutie+Honey+%5BJapan+2004%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55fad1b023d7a69492c98edb4bb3792e7a03b5fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,250,209,176,35,215,166,148,146,201,142,219,75,179,121,46,122,3,181,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
