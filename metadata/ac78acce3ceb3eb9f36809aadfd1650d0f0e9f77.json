Earlier this year, the Calgary city council voted 10-3 to remove the toxic substance from the cityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s drinking water. Connett is attempting to repeat this success elsewhere in Canada as well as in Austin, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nDuring the interview with Alex Jones, Dr. Connett presented in concise fashion overwhelming evidence of the health risks posed by water and food fluoridation.\n\nIn addition to dental fluorosis, the irreversible condition caused by excessive ingestion of fluoride during the tooth forming years, numerous studies have conclusively demonstrated that fluoride is responsible for a number of serious diseases ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ including bone cancer, arthritis, lower thyroid function, and disruption of the pineal gland and its production of melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate the onset of puberty. Alex noted studies revealing how fluoride is responsible for the early onset of puberty in girls and effeminacy in boys.\n\nDr. Connett also mentioned recent studies that prove fluorideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s primary and sole benefit to teeth comes from topical application to the surfaces of teeth and not from ingestion through water and food. The dental research community now admits that fluoride has little effect on preventing cavities in the pits and fissures ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the chewing surfaces ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ of teeth where the majority of tooth decay occurs. In short, there is absolutely no dental benefit, as often claimed, when fluoride is ingested.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDeadly Fluoride: Hoax on the Run!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is an excellent primer on the numerous dangers of fluoride. It also provides an update on anti-fluoride activism and the ongoing effort to have it removed from water systems, food, and most perniciously from baby dietary products.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac78acce3ceb3eb9f36809aadfd1650d0f0e9f77","amp;dn":"Deadly+Fluoride+%3A+Hoax+on+the+Run+%28Alex+Jones+Dr+Paul+Connett%29+w","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac78acce3ceb3eb9f36809aadfd1650d0f0e9f77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,120,172,206,60,235,62,185,243,104,9,170,223,209,101,13,15,14,159,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
