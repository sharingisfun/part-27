A concept album, Red Headed Stranger is about a fugitive preacher, on the run from the law after killing his wife. Sparse and jumbled, with brief, poetic lyrics, no one involved in the creation of the album thought it would sell well. In spite of its inaccessibility, Red Headed Stranger was a blockbuster among both country music and mainstream audiences, going multi-platinum and making Nelson one of the biggest stars in country. In 2003, the same year the album was ranked #184 on Rolling Stone&amp;#039;s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. It was ranked #1 on CMT&amp;#039;s 40 Greatest Albums in Country Music in 2006.&quot;\n\nIt&amp;#039;s a very, very good recording.
