A well-versed intellectual, in her second album Ã¢â‚¬ËœSilver or LeadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Rucker flexes her muscles delivering a full-on spoken word collection, with her characteristically frank, open and brutally poignant style. She offers heavy commentary on womanhood, slavery, politics, music and sexism, all in her trademark soft-spoken voice, set to music by dance music titans Jazzanova, 4 Hero, King Britt and Little Louie Vega. The effect is at times unnerving, at times palatable, but always full of depth and passion.\n\n- - -\n\nUrsula Rucker - Silver Or Lead 2003\n(K7)\n\n 1. Damned If I Do (with The Mysterium)  \n 2.
