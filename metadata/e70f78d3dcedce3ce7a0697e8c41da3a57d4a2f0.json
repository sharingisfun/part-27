Soon after Fela beat a marijuana possession charge, the police arrived at the compound with a search warrant and a joint they planned to plant on him. Apparently, Fela's reflexes were as fast as his wit, as he snatched the joint and swallowed it. The police promptly placed him in custody and would wait to examine his feces. With help from fellow inmates, the police wound up examining evidence that contained no trace of the drug and released Fela. The 1974 record Expensive Shit was Fela's response. Musically, &quot;Expensive Shit&quot; is the classic Afro-beat groove. The vibe is up-tempo and concise. As a keyboard chord progression and chorus line repeat to the outro and the choir finishes their rant, the pace slides on in an almost psychedelic fashion. The content of this song is quite funny and is one of his best scatological works. The B-side, &quot;Water Get No Enemy,&quot; is a flowing interaction between the musicians that is at once organic and contrived. On this track, Fela speaks a bit more metaphorically than its flip side, using water as the symbol of a respected power (the opposite of the powers that stood in Nigeria). &quot;Even if water kills your child, you still use water.&quot; The smallest collection of Fela Kuti CDs should contain Expensive Shit.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e70f78d3dcedce3ce7a0697e8c41da3a57d4a2f0","amp;dn":"Fela+Kuti+Expensive+Shit+%40256kb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e70f78d3dcedce3ce7a0697e8c41da3a57d4a2f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,15,120,211,220,237,206,60,231,160,105,126,140,65,218,58,87,212,162,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
