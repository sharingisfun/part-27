We all know how they govern, but the right-wing propaganda machine is very adept at hijacking debate and marketing their candidates as effectively as the Marlboro Man.\n\nFor example:\n\nMyth: The Republican nominee is an upstanding, regular guy who shares the values of the common man.\nReality: He divorced his first wife in order to marry a young multimillionaire heiress whose family then funded his political career.\n\nMyth: Republicans are strong on defense and will keep us safe.\nReality: They prey on fears, and their endless wars make America far less secure.\n\nMyth: Republicans are the party of fiscal restraint and small, limited government.\nReality: Soaring deficits, unchecked presidential power, and an increasingly invasive surveillance state are par for their course.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Intelligent, insightful.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Daily Kos\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Glenn Greenwald has done it again.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Alan Colmes\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Glenn Greenwald is a treasure.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€BuzzFlash\n\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fe9c8008d41d26dd6e538ba28e80b6a7f1f1358","amp;dn":"Great+American+Hypocrites-+Toppling+the+Big+Myths+of+Republican+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fe9c8008d41d26dd6e538ba28e80b6a7f1f1358","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,233,200,0,141,65,210,109,214,229,56,186,40,232,11,106,127,31,19,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
