Because Maya is based on an \n\nopen architecture, all your work can be scripted or programmed using a well-\n\ndocumented and comprehensive API (application programming interface) or one of two \n\nembedded scripting languages, the Maya Embedded Language (MEL) or PythonÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®. This \n\nlevel of openness, combined with an industry-leading suite of 3D tools, enables \n\nyou to realize your creative vision for your film, television, game development, \n\nand design projects.\n\n\n                WHY Autodesk MAYA 2009 ?????????????\n\n\n\nNew Selection Paradigm\nPowerful new selection features in Maya 2009ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including true soft selection, and pre-selection highlightingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½mean fewer mouse clicks, and less trial and error for common tasks.\n\nImproved Modeling Workflow \nMaya 2009 delivers intuitive, productive modeling enhancements, including symmetrical modeling with soft seams, a tweak mode for rapid modifications, and a new Merge Vertex feature that enables you to combine parts of a mesh.\n\nMaya Assets\nWith Maya Assets, complex data can be effectively organized, shared, referenced, and presented. Maya Assets enables you to encapsulate a set of nodes into a container so that they can be treated as if they were a single node from a userÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s perspective (selected attributes of interest from the contained nodes can be published to the container). This new feature also supports customized and user-specific views, flexible referencing, and the creation of customized libraries. \n\nAnimation Layering\nA powerful new animation layering paradigm, built on technology from AutodeskÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® MotionBuilderÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® software, gives you more flexibility as you nondestructively create and edit animation. This toolset works with any attribute: animation layers can be blended, merged, grouped, and reordered, and can override or add to preceding layers.\n\nMaya nParticles\nMaya 2009 introduces the second module built on the highly acclaimed Maya Nucleus unified simulation framework: Maya nParticles. This newest toolset gives you an intuitive, efficient workflow for simulating a wide range of complex effects, including liquids, clouds, smoke, spray, and dust. It features particle-to-particle collisions, particle and nCloth bidirectional interaction, powerful constraints, cloud and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œblobbyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ hardware display, preset rendering, and dynamic behaviors.\n\nMaya Muscle \nMaya 2009 includes the comprehensive Maya Muscle software, which helps you create life-like muscle and skin motion. This toolset allows you to direct muscle and skin behavior precisely, with secondary motion, collisions, wrinkles, sliding, and stickiness.\n\nUV Layout Enhancements\nThe ability to preserve UVs (when making modeling edits after the fact) as well as new UV unfolding and layout options ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including an interactive modeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½can increase your productivity by streamlining the otherwise time-consuming task of creating optimal texture coordinates.\n\nRender Proxy\nA new Render Proxy feature in mental rayÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® enables you to replace scene elements with a simple low-resolution mesh, and only load the pre-translated data when required for rendering. \n\nRender Pass Enhancements\nA completely updated Render Pass feature set provides precise control over render output, making it easier to optimize integration with compositing packages such as AutodeskÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® ToxikÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ software.\n\n\n\nAutodesk Mudbox 2009 &amp;  Autodesk Toxik will be uploaded soon.\n\nPLEASE HELP ME FOR SEEDING\n\nI BET ITS COMPLETELY VIRUS FREE .\n\nPLEASE HELP ME FOR SEEDING CAUSE I REALY DO CARE FOR U AND WANNA UPLOAD MORE AND MORE FOR YOU.\n\nFOR ANY OTHER PLATFORM PLEASE LEAVE FEED BACK AND FEEDBACK IS MUST.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f6fd905b84e60c598db01dc50169e65d86a8683","amp;dn":"Autodesk+Maya+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f6fd905b84e60c598db01dc50169e65d86a8683","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,111,217,5,184,78,96,197,152,219,1,220,80,22,158,101,216,106,134,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
