They drive forcefully on when Reid joins\nwith propulsive drums that show as much invention as LehmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lead lines.\nColtraneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s familiar melody peeks through only in very small windows, and when\nit shows up at the end of the song it is remixed, some key notes stretched\ndisproportionately long while others are left alone. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pure Imagination,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the\nballad from Ã¢â‚¬Å“Willy Wonka &amp; The Chocolate FactoryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ appears in similarly\ndistorted form, this time with dark minor bass drones from Brewer that\ntransform it from sweet to sinister.\n\nThe group surprises with swinging renditions of Duke PearsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“JeannineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and\nJackie McLeanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mr. E.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ When the breakbeat drumming and prismatic time\nrefractions of the other tracks are removed, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s striking how firmly rooted in\ntradition the musicians seem to be. LehmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s solos remain daringly distant from\nthe bass notes accompanying them, but they suddenly call to mind the calculated\ntonal romps of Lee Konitz and the knife-edge interjections of Jackie McLean\nmore strongly than in other contexts. His playing in this manner, though not\nground breaking, is highly accomplished and reveals his deep knowledge of and\nstrong respect the innovations that preceded his own.\n\nDemonstrating this affinity in a concert last winter at The Stone, Lehman spoke\nof how Ã¢â‚¬Å“interestingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“usefulÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the material Coltrane and his mentor McLean\nstill are for a contemporary musician.  This choice of adjectives parallels a\nsometimes-clinical approach that, along with a direct, no-frills alto tone,\nleaves Lehman open to the same accusations of frigidity that Konitz and other\ncool-school musicians received half a century before him. The music on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dialect\nFluorescentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ certainly isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t particularly warm-blooded or overtly emotional,\nbut engages with its intellectual invention, verve, and deeply felt sense of\ngroove throughout.\n\nHighly Recommended\n\n--\n\nBy Troy Collins &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=41759&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=41759&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Bill Shoemaker &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pointofdeparture.org/PoD38/PoD38MoreMoments6.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pointofdeparture.org/PoD38/PoD38MoreMoments6.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Michael Rosenstein &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dustedmagazine.com/reviews/7179&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dustedmagazine.com/reviews/7179&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPor Micky Almada (es)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:665269c83e90c0f672bb4f02b1c9a6d2668971bc","amp;dn":"Steve+Lehman+Trio+-+Dialect+Fluorescent+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"665269c83e90c0f672bb4f02b1c9a6d2668971bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,82,105,200,62,144,192,246,114,187,79,2,177,201,166,210,102,137,113,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
