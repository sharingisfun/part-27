Maybe that\nwas because Martine was busy filming &quot;Dr. Jeckyll and Sister Hyde&quot; in England.\n\nOne thing unique about the pilot is that Longstreet has an electronic cane\nthat produces audio beeps to assist him. By the start of the series\nhe has an ordinary cane still used by the blind to this day.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f23ef51993763472d0272503e737aba335fbd20","amp;dn":"LONGSTREET+--+TV-movie+pilot+%28+James+Franciscus%2C+John+McIntire+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f23ef51993763472d0272503e737aba335fbd20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,35,239,81,153,55,99,71,45,2,114,80,62,115,122,186,51,95,189,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
