Gilbert\n\nWith story contributions from Harvey Pekar and an art assist by Jeffrey Bonivert\n\n\nGreat anthology style short story collection from the early days of Aardvark-Vanaheim. Includes a couple of short stories that previously appeared in Imagine and Slow Death, but it's largely original material. The many different styles of art that seem to have flowed effortlessly from Gilbert's hands is pretty amazing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:768ee1cfaa934d45df8782f00fcf07ff273be0c6","amp;dn":"Michael+T+Gilbert+-+Strange+Brew+%28Underground+-+Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"768ee1cfaa934d45df8782f00fcf07ff273be0c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,142,225,207,170,147,77,69,223,135,130,240,15,207,7,255,39,59,224,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
