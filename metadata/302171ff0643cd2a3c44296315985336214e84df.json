Release notes ??????????????????????????????????????? ??? ? ?\n\n     After a host of disappointing solo albums and\n     quickly diminishing celebrity (most of the latter\n     devoted to the continuing extra-legal saga of Ol&amp;#039; Dirty\n     Bastard), Wu-Tang Clan returned, very quietly, with\n     2000&amp;#039;s The W.The lack of hype was fitting, for this is\n     a very spartan work, especially compared to its\n     predecessor,the sprawling and overblown Wu-Tang\n     Forever. While the trademark sound is still much in\n     force, group mastermind RZA jettisoned the elaborate\n     beat symphonies and carefully placed strings of Forever\n     in favor of tight productions with little more than\n     scarred soul samples and tight, tough beats. The back-\n     to-basics approach works well, not only because it\n     rightly puts the focus back on the best cadre of\n     rappers in the world of hip-hop, but also because RZA&amp;#039;s\n     immense trackmaster talents can&amp;#039;t help but shine\n     through anyway.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:302171ff0643cd2a3c44296315985336214e84df","amp;dn":"Wu-Tang_Clan-The_W-2000-CBM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"302171ff0643cd2a3c44296315985336214e84df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,33,113,255,6,67,205,42,60,68,41,99,21,152,83,54,33,78,132,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
