That the average medieval warrior became a full-fledged fighter by the time he was fifteen years old? Or that armor made by a master could, by modern standards, cost the price of a Rolls Royce?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b07945fd536c16e28c785ca02b40ce04f645461","amp;dn":"A+Knight+and+His+Weapons+%28History+War%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b07945fd536c16e28c785ca02b40ce04f645461","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,7,148,95,213,54,193,110,40,199,133,202,2,180,12,224,79,100,84,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
