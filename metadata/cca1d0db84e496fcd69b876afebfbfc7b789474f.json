In this volume, we'll begin prototyping the functionality of our game boss using the powerful Unity game engine.\n\nWe'll begin by discussing the design of our boss battle. This will help us stay on task and identify any holes in our logic. Once we have a solid understanding of our gameplay design, we'll begin to configure the assets for the game boss and the battle environment. After that, we'll begin scripting each phase of the boss battle. We'll begin with small tasks, but before long we'll have an entire system that will become more and more powerful.\n\nOnce you've completed this volume, you can move on to Volume 4 where we'll go through the process of modeling and texturing the main character. Then you can continue on with the subsequent volumes on modeling and texturing the game boss, rigging, animation and final game assembly. These tutorials are step-by-step using our particular concepts, but we really encourage you to have some fun and make it your own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cca1d0db84e496fcd69b876afebfbfc7b789474f","amp;dn":"Indie+Game+Development+Pipeline+Volume+3%3A+Game+Boss+Prototyping","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cca1d0db84e496fcd69b876afebfbfc7b789474f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,161,208,219,132,228,150,252,214,155,135,106,254,191,191,199,183,137,71,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
