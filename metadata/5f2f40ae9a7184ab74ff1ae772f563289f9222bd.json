The band recently completed the North-East leg of Taking Back SundayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fall 2004 tour, and more recently played sold-out shows with The Used, My Chemical Romace, Coheed and Cambria, Midtown and Starting line which solidified Like YesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strong and growing fan base. \n\nLike Yesterday has also completed their first EP with Producer/Engineer Paul Mahajan (Yeah Yeah Yeahs, TV On The Radio, The Liars) and Producer Jamie Siegel (Lauryn Hill, Smashing Pumpkins, Del Amitri, The Movie Life) and went on to record a mini-album set to be released in May 2005 under Brian MaloufÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Columbia imprint label Bandha Records.\n\nMark Holmes (vocals), Dave Holmes (guitar), and Joe Tomino (drums), were working on putting a band together when they encountered the strong songwriting of newcomer, Seva Granik (guitar). As Mark Holmes explains, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I had been looking to put something like this together but didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know where to start until I met Seva. He had these great songs without any lyricsÃ¢â‚¬â€I instantly knew he was someone I wanted to work with.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ GranikÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songwriting talent comes together perfectly with lead singer Mark HolmesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ piercing, and emotional vocals and the versatility and technical prowess of Joe Tomino and Dave Holmes.\n\nBought the CD off of Amazon.
