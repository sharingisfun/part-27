These injuries are often caused by static postures or repetitive movements that have to be maintained for many hours a day, such as intensive use of data entry devices, assembly work, parts inspection, equipment maintenance, manual materials handling, machinery operations, and vehicle operation, among others. In order to prevent such injuries, occupational health professionals, ergonomists, production engineers, and product designers need to know how to evaluate postures and movements, and understand how these are determined by the work environment, as well as what design tools are available to achieve less stressful working postures and movements.
