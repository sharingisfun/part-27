Ed Roland knows how to co-opt contemporary alternative rock trends and refashion them into hard-rocking anthems, as evidenced by the first single, &quot;Precious Declaration.&quot; He still has a problem coming up with a consistent set of songs, but Disciplined Breakdown is nearly as slickly entertaining as Collective Soul's eponymous second album, and its best moments indicate that Roland is beginning to develop a distinctive hard rock style of his own.\n\n01 Precious Declaration  Roland     3:41\n02 Listen                Roland     4:14\n03 Maybe                 Roland     4:09\n04 Full Circle           Roland     4:09\n05 Blame                 Roland     4:42\n06 Disciplined Breakdown Roland     2:55\n07 Forgiveness           Roland     5:02\n08 Link                  Roland     3:04\n09 Giving                Roland     3:06\n10 In Between            Roland     4:03\n11 Crowded Head          Roland     3:40\n12 Everything            Roland     3:46","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c0c4247d71e9c9bc31f9d05d4dd121b961cf18f","amp;dn":"Collective+Soul+-+1997+-+Disciplined+Breakdown+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c0c4247d71e9c9bc31f9d05d4dd121b961cf18f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,12,66,71,215,30,156,155,195,31,157,5,212,221,18,27,150,28,241,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
