If\nyou have attended a conference sponsored by IACSIT before, you are aware that the conferences\ntogether report the results of research efforts in a broad range of computer science. These conferences\nare aimed at discussing with all of you the wide range of problems encountered in present and future\nhigh technologies. The ICCET 2009, ICACC 2009 and ICECS 2008 are organized to gather members\nof our international community of computer and control scientists so that researchers from around the\nworld can present their leading-edge work, expanding our communityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s knowledge and insight into\nthe significant challenges currently being addressed in that research. The conference Program\nCommittee is itself quite diverse and truly international, with membership from the Americas, Europe,\nAsia, Africa and Oceania.\nThis proceeding records the fully refereed papers presented at the conference. The main conference\nthemes and tracks are Computer Engineering and Technology. The conference aims to bring together\nresearchers, scientists, engineers, and practitioners to exchange and share their experiences, new ideas,\nand research results about all aspects of the main conference themes and tracks and discuss the\npractical challenges encountered and the solutions adopted. The main goal of these events is to\nprovide international scientific forums for exchange of new ideas in a number of fields that interact\nin-depth through discussions with their peers from around the world. Both inward research; core areas\nof computer control and outward research; multi-disciplinary, inter-disciplinary, and applications will\nbe covered during these events.\nThe conference has solicited and gathered technical research submissions related to all aspects of\nmajor conference themes and tracks. All the submitted papers in the proceeding have been peer\nreviewed by the reviewers drawn from the scientific committee, external reviewers and editorial board\ndepending on the subject matter of the paper. Reviewing and initial selection were undertaken\nelectronically. After the rigorous peer-review process, the submitted papers were selected on the basis\nof originality, significance, and clarity for the purpose of the conference. The selected papers and\nadditional late-breaking contributions to be presented as lectures will make an exiting technical\nprogram. The conference program is extremely rich, featuring high-impact presentations.\nxiv\nThe high quality of the program ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guaranteed by the presence of an unparalleled number of\ninternationally recognized top experts ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ can be assessed when reading the contents of the program.\nThe conference will therefore be a unique event, where attendees will be able to appreciate the latest\nresults in their field of expertise, and to acquire additional knowledge in other fields. The program has\nbeen structured to favor interactions among attendees coming from many diverse horizons,\nscientifically, geographically, from academia and from industry. Included in this will to favor\ninteractions are social events at prestigious sites.\nWe would like to thank the program chairs, organization staff, and the members of the program\ncommittees for their work. Thanks also go to Ms. Lisa O'Conner, CPS Production Editor, Conference\nPublishing Services (CPS), IEEE Computer Society, for her wonderful editorial service to this\nproceeding.\nWe are grateful to all those who have contributed to the success of ICCET 2009. We hope that all\nparticipants and other interested readers benefit scientifically from the proceedings and also find it\nstimulating in the process. Finally, we would like to wish you success in your technical presentations\nand social networking.\nWe hope you have a unique, rewarding and enjoyable week at ICCET 2009, ICACC 2009 and ICECS\n2008 in Singapore.\nWith our warmest regards,\nYi Xie\nJanuary 22 - 24, 2009\nSingapore","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c075145794a596822aaae19e55d38c1b8892698b","amp;dn":"2009+International+Conference+on+Computer+Engineering+and+Techno","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c075145794a596822aaae19e55d38c1b8892698b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,117,20,87,148,165,150,130,42,170,225,158,85,211,140,27,136,146,105,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
