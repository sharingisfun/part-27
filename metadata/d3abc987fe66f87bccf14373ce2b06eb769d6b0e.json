Culled from the vaults of the legendary Sun Records, this 3-disc set documents Cash's most prolific period as a songwriter, and is the perfect showcase for his dark country stylings and dry, witty lyrics. Includes the tracks 'I Walk The Line', 'Give My Love To Rose' and 'Folsom Prison Blues'.\n\nDisc 01\n\n[01] I Walk The Line\n[02] Get Rhythm\n[03] There You Go\n[04] Train Of Love\n[05] Cry! Cry!
