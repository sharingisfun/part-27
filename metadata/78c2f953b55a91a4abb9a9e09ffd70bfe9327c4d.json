It was so crowded that I could pick BOTH feet off\nthe floor.  The band was pouring with sweat (along with everyone at the \nshow), but somehow they managed to pull off a really long show.  I remember\nJohn Bell leaning off the stage soaked and had this evil grin on his face\nduring parts of the show.  Definitely my favorite Panic show that I've\nbeen to.\n\n\nDisc 1\nSet I\n01.
