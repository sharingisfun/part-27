Joy's voice is incredible.  She really establishes herself as a unique artist. There really isn't a weak song on here, but &quot;New Day&quot;, &quot;Desperate&quot;, &quot;and &quot;Beautiful Somehow&quot; especially stand out. This is a huge step forward not only for Joy, but also Christian music. \n\n\nTORRENTED BY:\n\nTorrent Tracts, June 2009\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0ebd805775a35f8d8387172bb3799699a194198","amp;dn":"Joy+Williams+-+2002+-+By+Surprise","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0ebd805775a35f8d8387172bb3799699a194198","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,235,216,5,119,90,53,248,216,56,113,114,187,55,153,105,154,25,65,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
