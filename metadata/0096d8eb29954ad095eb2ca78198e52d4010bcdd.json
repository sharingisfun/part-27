Their sound, lyrics, vocals...everything just oozes awesome--especially when I listen in FLAC--right into my ear holes. I'm uploading this here so everyone else can have awesome oozed into their ear holes, too.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\nMachinae Supremacy is a Swedish band that combines modern heavy metal and alternative rock with chiptunes. Self-defined as &quot;SID metal&quot;, many of their songs use a SidStation that features the SID chip of the Commodore 64. They have released a considerable number of songs for free download on their site, 32 original recordings, with approximately 100,000 downloads a month.\n\nThis torrent contains their 2012 album, Rise of a Digital Nation, in glorious FLAC.\n\nFROM THE BAND on Reddit:\n&quot;Sharing is caring. And don't be selfish. Seed what you leech.&quot;\n\nEnjoy. \\m/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0096d8eb29954ad095eb2ca78198e52d4010bcdd","amp;dn":"Machinae+Supremacy+-+Rise+of+a+Digital+Nation+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0096d8eb29954ad095eb2ca78198e52d4010bcdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,150,216,235,41,149,74,208,149,235,44,167,129,152,229,45,64,16,188,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
