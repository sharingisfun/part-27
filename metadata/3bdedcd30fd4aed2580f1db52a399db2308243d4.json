The group is notable for having started the careers of three of rock's most famous guitarists: Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Jimmy Page, all of whom were in the top fifteen of Rolling Stone's 100 Top Guitarists list (Clapton as #4, Page as #9, and Beck as #14). A blues-based band that broadened its range into pop and rock, The Yardbirds were pioneers in guitar innovations of the '60s: fuzz tone, feedback, distortion, backwards echo, improved amplification, etc. Pat Pemberton, writing for Spinner, holds that the Yardbirds were &quot;the most impressive guitar band in rock music&quot;. After the Yardbirds broke up in 1968, their current lead guitarist Jimmy Page founded what became Led Zeppelin.\n\nThe bulk of the band's most successful self-written songs came from bassist/producer Paul Samwell-Smith who, with singer/harmonica player Keith Relf, drummer Jim McCarty and rhythm guitarist/bassist Chris Dreja, constituted the core of the group. The band reformed in the 1990s, featuring McCarty, Dreja and new members. The Yardbirds were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Yardbirds&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Yardbirds&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nCD1:\n\n01 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ For Your Love\n02 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Heart Full Of Soul\n03 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Evil Hearted You\n04 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Shapes Of Things\n05 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ A Certain Girl\n06 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ I Wish You Would\n07 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ I AinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Got You\n08 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Boom Boom\n09 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Good Morning Little School Girl\n10 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Talking Bout You\n11 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ My Girl Sloopy\n12 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ JeffÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Boogie\n13 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Train Kept A Rollin\n14 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Here ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Tis\n15 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Lost Women\n16 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Smokestack Lightning (Live)\n17 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ JeffÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Blues\n18 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Nazz Are Blue\n19 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Got To Hurry\n20 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Too Much Monkey Business\n\n\n\n\n\nCD2:\n\n01 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Over Under Sideways Down\n02 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Happenings Ten Years Time Ago\n03 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m A Man\n04 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Stroll On\n05 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Mister YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re a Better Man Than I\n06 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Still IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m Sad\n07 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Ever Since The World Began\n08 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Putty In Your Hands\n09 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ What Do You Want\n10 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Rack My Mind\n11 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m Not Talking\n12 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ I AinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Done Wrong\n13 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Psycho Daisies\n14 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ I CanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Make Your Way\n15 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Someone To Love\n16 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Mr Zero ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Keith Relf\n17 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Honey In Your Hips\n18 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Sweet Music\n19 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Steeled Blues\n20 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Louise (Live)\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info:\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theyardbirds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theyardbirds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Yardbirds&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Yardbirds&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Yardbirds_discography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Yardbirds_discography&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rockhall.com/inductees/the-yardbirds/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rockhall.com/inductees/the-yardbirds/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENJOY &amp; REMEMBER TO KEEP SEEDING FOR OTHERS!!!\nTHANKS!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bdedcd30fd4aed2580f1db52a399db2308243d4","amp;dn":"The+Yardbirds+-+Shapes+of+Things+%28The+Best+of+The+Yardbirds%29%282CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bdedcd30fd4aed2580f1db52a399db2308243d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,222,220,211,15,212,174,210,88,15,29,181,42,57,157,178,48,130,67,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
