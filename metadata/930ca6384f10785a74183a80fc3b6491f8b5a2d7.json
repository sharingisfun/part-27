The Georgia legislature drew the line where Bill Clinton did, saying your freedom to engage in relationships doesnâ€™t mean you can coerce others to violate their religious beliefs by participating in ceremonial celebrations of that relationship. Republican Gov Nathan Deal, under pressure from large corporations and LGBT groups has vetoed protection of religious liberty.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, a train company has introduced women-only carriages to protect women from migrant sex attacks as in North Carolina the legislature has moved to protect women from sexual predation by maintaining separate bathrooms for men and women. In both cases, the politically correct left places a higher value on promoting open borders or transgender sexuality than protecting women\r\n\r\nThe Solution to the Robot Takeover Revealed\r\n\r\nWhile millenials couldn't care less about property rights - and the mineral rights that come with them - they're missing an opportunity to be compensated for another type of mining. Tech Companies make billions mining our personal data, maybe it's time they pay us a percentage of the resulting revenue. That's one way to pay for the basic income Americans will most certainly need once automation makes the human worker (and our income) obsolete.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Great American Land Grab\r\n\r\nWe have sold our birthright, our land &amp; natural resources, for cheap trinkets made in China and the title is changing is changing hands now with massive purchases by foreign countries and companies. But the biggest land grab has been Obama, taking over 265 Million acres of land &amp; water with the stroke of pen.\r\n\r\n147 FBI Agents Look at Hillary, But Itâ€™s a â€œHigher Barâ€ Since Sheâ€™s Running for President\r\n\r\nShould presidential candidates be given immunity from prosecution for crimes they commit? Ron Fournier, National Journal, thinks they should. \r\nAnd Michael Hayden, appointed NSA head by Bill Clinton and as CIA head by George W Bush, attacks Trump again while praising Hillary. This time itâ€™s because Trump is offerring a foreign policy he describes as â€œAmerica Firstâ€ â€” heresy for the multinational neocons.\r\n\r\n20160328_Mon_NightlyNews.mp4 - 01:00:03 700 x 394\r\n\r\nScreens: \nhttp://i.imgur.com/6TaiYUW.png \nhttp://i.imgur.com/UmMNVnH.png \nhttp://i.imgur.com/yG7eGsc.png","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:930ca6384f10785a74183a80fc3b6491f8b5a2d7","amp;dn":"The++Infowars+Nightly+News+-+March+28%2C+2016+Terror+Is+On+The+Ris","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"930ca6384f10785a74183a80fc3b6491f8b5a2d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,12,166,56,79,16,120,90,116,24,58,128,252,59,100,145,248,181,162,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
