I've managed to get Polish DVD so this release got Polish and Hungarian dubbings, Russian and Ukrainian subtitles and updated Czech, Turkish and Russian audiotracks (which is of higher quality than in Russian disks).\n\nOriginal text message from the first release below:\n\nRemembering W.I.T.C.H. in late 2014 after twitter hype of W.I.T.C.H. vs Winx fandom, I decided to rewatch this series that I remembered for the simple but stunning plot first of all, for for its' dynamics and interestingness overall. This series left a vivid impression 10 years ago when I was about the same age as the girls in the series. I decided to watch the series in English (I'm from Russia) as it lost a lot of original jokes charm after adaptation for Russian-speaking audience, and to my surprise have found only TVrips with horrible video and audio quality. I do not know what came over me, but I've spent about 3 months finding DVDs on the Internet, realizing that most of the links have long been dead and both eDonkey and DC++ only have the same TVRips and torrents are stalled for months without any seeds (but with 4 peers!) to order these DVDs (which was not too easy, too).\nUnfortunately, the DVDs themselves are far from perfect: interlaced content in the progressive source, aliasing, banding, encoding artifacts, audio desync and other things. I've spent considerable amount of time watching and correcting these flaws so I hope you enjoy the result, at least I'm happy with it.\nToo bad that only UK video version have been released on the DVD, so there is no US intro or Italian/French/US openings.\nThis release contains all high quality audio dubbings I could find regardless of their origin. Some Czech audio fragments were corrupted and have been replaced by English version.\nPolish DVDs with missing Polish and Hungarian audio and Ukrainian subtitles are hard to buy in a pack. If I ever buy it, I'll probably make updated version of this release.
