He recently decided that he\nhad amassed enough content for this project to give it a name and share it with\nthe rest of us. The album is entitled Soundtrack For The Voices In My Head Vol.\n01, and is primarily instrumental and score based, showing a progression of\nKlaytonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vision for Film/TV/Video Game/Movie Trailer music scoring and\nlicensing. The release has been produced, written, recorded and mixed by\nKlayton, with the guest orchestration talent of composer Tom Salta (Atlas Plug)\non the track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUrsa Minor.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\n\nThe album will also include a few bonus versions of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBirthrightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from the\nupcoming Celldweller sophomore release, including the &quot;Instrumental Trailer Mix&quot;\nwhich features the orchestration and choir of film composer James Dooley.  The\n&quot;Birthright (Instrumental Trailer Mix)&quot; is the version that was recently\nfeatured in the &quot;Speed Racer&quot; trailer and &quot;Iron Man&quot; TV spots.  Klayton will\nalso release the original demo of the song formerly known as &quot;Baseline,&quot; which\nwas licensed for the &quot;Spider-man 3&quot; and &quot;The Last Legion&quot; TV spots.  The full\nprogression of the song will be heard when the final version is released on the\nnext Celldweller full-length album.\n\n\n\nWith KlaytonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s signature writing and production style, coupled with his wide\nvariety of instruments and sounds, the Soundtrack For The Voices In My Head\nseries is ready to leave a trail of melodies and progressions in every\nlistenerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s head, long after the music has stopped.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e8e4f61fa5223e776fb6bd4844a089eab781918","amp;dn":"Celldweller-Soundtrack_For_The_Voices_In_My_Head_Vol._1-2008-XXL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e8e4f61fa5223e776fb6bd4844a089eab781918","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,142,79,97,250,82,35,231,118,251,107,212,132,74,8,158,171,120,25,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
