The 18 revised full papers presented together with 4 invited talks were carefully reviewed and selected from 40 submissions. The aim of FORMATS is to promote the study of fundamental and practical aspects of timed systems, and to bring together researchers from different disciplines that share interests in the modelling and analysis of timed systems.Typical topics include (but are not limited to): Foundations and Semantics. Theoretical foundations of timed systems and languages; comparison between different models (timed automata, timed Petri nets, hybrid automata, timed process algebra, max-plus algebra, probabilistic models), methods and Tools. Techniques, algorithms, data structures, and software tools for analyzing timed systems and resolving temporal constraints (scheduling, worst-case execution time analysis, optimization, model checking, testing, constraint solving, etc.), applications. Adaptation and specialization of timing technology in application domains in which timing plays an important role (real-time software, hardware circuits, and problems of scheduling in manufacturing and telecommunication).\n\n \n\nTable of Contents\n\nTapas: Theory Combinations and Practical Applications\n\n     Introduction\n\n     Empanadas: SMT\n\n     Boquerones: Dynamic Symbolic Execution
