It is a Windows based application that can be used to create a Live Multiboot USB or even a Multiboot ISO file that can then be burnt to a CD/DVD. XBOOT supports many Linux Distributions and Utilities, and allows you to use your choice of a Grub or Syslinux bootloader. Also included is a built in QEMU emulator (enabling you to boot an ISO from within Windows).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75bd38a0aa073ee837dabd995ed3477183a8ccfa","amp;dn":"XBoot+v1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75bd38a0aa073ee837dabd995ed3477183a8ccfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,189,56,160,170,7,62,232,55,218,189,153,94,211,71,113,131,168,204,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
