The prophesied End of All Days is about to begin. As the armies of darkness begin their initial attacks, Thor confronts Loki, who is destined to usher in the fall of Asgard. But what Thor learns from Loki may change the way he sees his treacherous half-brother. For perhaps this terrible event is a time also of renewal. Perhaps in this desperate hour, even the God of Lies has a purpose.&quot;\n\nThis digital copy is by Minutemen-InnderDemons; thanks to them and please seed, enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b67f3394663b6b912325acc7687e3805af953e41","amp;dn":"Thor%3A+Heaven+%26amp%3B+Earth+01-04+%282011%7CDigital%7CMM-InnerDemons%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b67f3394663b6b912325acc7687e3805af953e41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,127,51,148,102,59,107,145,35,37,172,199,104,126,56,5,175,149,62,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
