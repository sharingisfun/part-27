With the help of the Cul-de-sac Crew, Grayson tricks Jules into being less predictable in her day-to-day life, but when she fails, Grayson is able to plan ahead and propose to her outside at night under a teepee'd tree. The season follows the ups and downs of their engagement, including their many trips to a new psychiatrist (played by guest star Nicole Sullivan). Laurie guilts Jules into letting her be Co-Made of Honor (Co-Mo's!) with Ellie, much to Ellie's dismay. Travis gets into a skateboarding accident while being pulled by Dog Travis, and goes into the hospital. His injury causes him to wear a helmet for six episodes. Laurie falls for a guy via twitter, a soldier from Iraq named Wade. Meanwhile, Bobby falls for Travis photography professor Angie (recurring guest star Sarah Chalke). In &quot;A One Story Town&quot;, Jules and the gang decide Bobby needs help with Angie so they start &quot;operation kiss-the-girl&quot;. With help from Ted and his a'capella group, they pull it off and Bobby and Angie get together. (This episode also signifies a special &quot;Scrubs&quot; Cast Reunion including: Christa Miller, Sarah Chalke, Bob Clendenin, Ken Jenkins, Sam Lloyd, Robert Maschio, and Zach Braff). When one of Grayson's old hook-ups, Holly, returns with big news... that Grayson has a baby! Although Jules is extremely upset at first, she comes to terms with the fact that baby girl Tampa will be in Grayson's life from now on. Bobby soon finds out that Angie is cheating on him, although she says they never agreed to be exclusive, and they break up. Ellie's mom is introduced, and although Ellie tries to tell the Crew, no one will believe that her mother is a sociopath. When a hurricane strikes Gulfhaven, Travis and Laurie get closer than ever when she can't decide what to do about her army boyfriend, Wade. Although he has feelings for her, Travis wants to see Laurie happy so tells her to try to make it work with Wade. The hurricane destroys Grayson's house causing him to move in with Jules. Grayson wants his and Jules's relationship to be more private and suggests that they elope in Napa, but Jules invites the whole group. While there, Travis and Laurie almost kiss but are interrupted when her boyfriend, Wade comes back from Iraq to see her. The night of Travis's 21st birthday he gets drunk, strips, and tells Laurie that he has feelings for her and she is being unfair to him. Because Grayson's daughter isn't with them, they decide not to elope, but get married closer to home. Jules and Grayson get married on the beach near their home, but because beach weddings aren't legal there, it becomes a wedding on the go, and walk down the beach as they say their vows.\n\nTrama\n\nJules ÃƒÂ¨ una donna di quarant'anni, bella e affascinante, che si ÃƒÂ¨ sposata in giovane etÃƒÂ  e che ha dedicato la sua vita alla famiglia, suo marito e suo figlio, ormai adolescente.
