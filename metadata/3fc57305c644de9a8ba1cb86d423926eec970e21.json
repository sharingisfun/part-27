This version also has the original uncompressed audio in PCM. I have personally verified that it burns and works fine on my blu-ray player, a Panasonic BD35k.  I would be curious to know what luck people have with other models of blu-ray players.\n\n\nSita Sings the Blues\nwww.sitasingstheblues.com\nDirected, written, produced, designed and animated by Nina Paley\n82 minutes\nAnimation\nColor, stereo\n2008\n\nSynopsis:\nSita is a goddess separated from her beloved Lord and husband Rama.
