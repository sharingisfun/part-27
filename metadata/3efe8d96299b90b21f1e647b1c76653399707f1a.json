Obviously not HD (Maybe someday?)\n\n~ Green Devil\n\nSIDE NOTE: Glenn handled the &quot;pass-out&quot; situation really well, and I believe his quick reaction, as well as words coming out of the break, are indicative of the good-hearted character he embodies. You may not like his politics, but give the guy a break once in a while. \n\nYou can find that at time index 10:55, as I know some of you are only downloading it just because of that.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3efe8d96299b90b21f1e647b1c76653399707f1a","amp;dn":"Glenn+Beck+FOX+NEWS+04.13.09+%7C%7C+GREENDEVIL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3efe8d96299b90b21f1e647b1c76653399707f1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,254,141,150,41,155,144,178,31,30,100,123,28,118,101,51,153,112,127,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
