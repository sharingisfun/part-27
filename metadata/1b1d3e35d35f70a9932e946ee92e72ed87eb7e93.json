It will also serve advanced radar academic and training courses with a complete set of problems for students as well as solutions for instructors. This book provides an introduction to advanced radar methods available, spanning the gamut of the most exciting radar capabilities, from exotic waveforms, to ultrahigh resolution 2D and 3D imaging methods, complex adaptive interference cancellation, multitarget tracking in dense scenarios and more. The most uptodate methods, such as multipleinput, multipleoutput (MIMO) are covered. All of this material is presented with the same careful balance of quantitative rigor and qualitative insight of Principles of Modern Radar: Basic Principles (SciTech 2010).\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://images.whitcoulls.co.nz/images/whit/97818911/9781891121531/0/0/plain/principles-of-modern-radar-advanced-techniques-v-2-advanced-radar-techniques-and-applications.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://images.whitcoulls.co.nz/images/whit/97818911/9781891121531/0/0/plain/principles-of-modern-radar-advanced-techniques-v-2-advanced-radar-techniques-and-applications.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAbout the Author :-\n\nWilliam L. Melvin is Director of the Sensors and Electromagnetic Applications Laboratory (SEAL) at the Georgia Tech Research Institute and an Adjunct Professor in Georgia TechÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Electrical and Computer Engineering Department.\n\nJames A. Scheer has been directly involved radar research and development for over 40 years. He is an instructor in a variety of radar short courses, including Principles of Modern Radar.\n\n\n\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b1d3e35d35f70a9932e946ee92e72ed87eb7e93","amp;dn":"Principles+of+Modern+Radar+prabhu_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b1d3e35d35f70a9932e946ee92e72ed87eb7e93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,29,62,53,211,95,112,169,147,46,148,110,233,46,114,237,135,235,126,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
