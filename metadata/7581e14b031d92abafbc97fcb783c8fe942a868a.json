It runs about 21 minutes and still contains the bits of dialog that are there during the songs, but I gave it some EQ adjustments to boost the bass levels and level out some of the grating high end in some spots.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7581e14b031d92abafbc97fcb783c8fe942a868a","amp;dn":"Emmet+Otter%5C%27s+Jug-Band+Christmas+-+Original+Soundtrack+%28320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7581e14b031d92abafbc97fcb783c8fe942a868a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,129,225,75,3,29,146,171,175,188,151,252,183,131,200,254,148,42,134,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
