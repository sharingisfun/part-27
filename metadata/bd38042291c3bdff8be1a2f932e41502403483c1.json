The release of Vapor Trails marked the first studio album for the band in six years, (since Test for Echo in 1996) because of personal tragedies that befell drummer Neil Peart in the late 1990s. According to the band, the entire developmental process for Vapor Trails was extremely taxing and took approximately 14 months to finish, by far the longest the band had ever spent writing and recording a studio album. Despite controversy surrounding its production and sound quality, the album debuted to moderate praise and was supported by the band's first tour in six years, including first-ever concerts in Mexico City and Brazil, where they played to some of the largest crowds of their career. The album was certified gold in Canada in August 2002. \n\nThe song &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; appeared on the album and was written by Peart as a tribute to his travels around North America after his tragic loss, while &quot;One Little Victory&quot; served as the first single in order to announce the band's return from hiatus.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;One Little Victory&quot;   \t5:08\n02. \t&quot;Ceiling Unlimited&quot;   \t5:28\n03. \t&quot;Ghost Rider&quot;   \t5:41\n04. \t&quot;Peaceable Kingdom&quot;   \t5:23\n05. \t&quot;The Stars Look Down&quot;   \t4:28\n06. \t&quot;How It Is&quot;   \t4:05\n07. \t&quot;Vapor Trail&quot;   \t4:57\n08. \t&quot;Secret Touch&quot;   \t6:34\n09. \t&quot;Earthshine&quot;   \t5:38\n10. \t&quot;Sweet Miracle&quot;   \t3:40\n11. \t&quot;Nocturne&quot;   \t4:49\n12. \t&quot;Freeze (Part IV of 'Fear')&quot;   \t6:21\n13. \t&quot;Out Of The Cradle&quot;   \t5:03","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd38042291c3bdff8be1a2f932e41502403483c1","amp;dn":"Rush+-+Vapor+Trails+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd38042291c3bdff8be1a2f932e41502403483c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,56,4,34,145,195,189,255,139,225,162,249,50,228,21,2,64,52,131,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
