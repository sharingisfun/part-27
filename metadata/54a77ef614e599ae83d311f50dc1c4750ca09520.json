KtC lets everyone know that Paltalk is being tested which leads to a touch of Ã¢â‚¬Å“gay talkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from the guys and obvious red flags in chatrooms and strip clubs. Ant shows Dan a video of a woman Ã¢â‚¬Å“salsa chippingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ herself on a train, discuss Asian chicks and fetishes, and the countless things that Hitler ruined. After a few lost feeds (bear with us folks!), they talk about their Ã¢â‚¬Å“future selves,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ slow-motion iPhone videos, and Sandy Kane in Cosmo magazine. Thanks to the good for nothing TriCaster, the boys are forced to do the show via iPhone and talk about Dan being on the O&amp;J show minus Ant, they swap family divorce stories, get into the difference between lust and love, and possible ideas for keeping kink in a marriage. They wrap up by chatting about ISIS, working from home, video games, and mortality","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54a77ef614e599ae83d311f50dc1c4750ca09520","amp;dn":"TACS+-+The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-10-15.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54a77ef614e599ae83d311f50dc1c4750ca09520","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,167,126,246,20,229,153,174,131,211,17,245,13,193,196,117,12,160,149,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
