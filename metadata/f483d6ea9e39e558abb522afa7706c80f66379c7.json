Brown II, has been one of the most influential bands of the past two-and-a-half decades helping shape the early thrash and speed metal scene of the late 80Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s and early 90Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s.\n\nWith the release of their first major label album in 1989 on Intense Records, they floored the industry with their rapid popularity and units sold for a band that stayed primarily in the underground. Produced by metal veteran producer Bill Metoyer, the effort showed how diverse and original their sound really was. Metoyer was quoted as saying Ã¢â‚¬Å“This is the most unique sound in this particular genre, they have coupled together melodic vocals with very heavy aggressive music.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nWith some weighty style changes and more than a few personnel changes along the way, Deliverance released a total of seven studio CDs by 1995 and went on to release two additional studio albums in 2001 and 2007 respectively.\n\nNow in 2012, Deliverance is back and set to reclaim their place as major players in the thrash and speed metal scene. 3 Frogz Records in association with Roxx Productions have announced DeliveranceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tenth studio cd titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hear What I Say!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nDeliverance 2012 features founder and main song-writer Jimmy P. Brown II on vocals and guitar, Michael Phillips on lead guitar (Deliverance, The Sacrificed, Join The Dead), Manny Morales on bass and making his debut to the Deliverance line-up, drumming legend Jayson Sherlock (Mortification, Horde, Paramecium).\n\n\n\nThe 1994 release of A Decade Of.....
