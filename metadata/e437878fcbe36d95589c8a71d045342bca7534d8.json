The book also gives an objective and up to date assessment of the scientific basis for the medical use of cannabis and what risks this may entail. The recreational use of the drug and how it affects users is described along with some predictions about how attitudes to cannabis use may change in the future. The book is written with a minimum of scientific jargon or technical language for readers who want to know more about the science that underlies the current cannabis debate.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e437878fcbe36d95589c8a71d045342bca7534d8","amp;dn":"The+Science+of+Marijuana","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e437878fcbe36d95589c8a71d045342bca7534d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,55,135,143,203,227,109,149,88,156,138,113,208,69,52,43,202,117,52,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
