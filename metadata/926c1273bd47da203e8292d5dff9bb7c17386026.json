The Kink Kontroversy is a transitional work, with elements of both the earlier Kinks' styles (heavily blues-influenced songs and variations on the band's hits from 1964-65) and early indications of the future direction of Ray Davies songwriting styles. With The Kink Kontroversy we have the backdrop of a band struggling with itself and with the authorities, going into the studio and coming out the other side with an album which shows a band on the up and freeing up room for itself so it can prosper and develop further in later years.\n\nDisc: 1 \n\n1.
