In desperation he turns to Freddy Fitzgerald, a rebellious writer who still maintains connections from his days as a street hooligan. For Lumpen to get ahead of his even less scrupulous competitors he must steal an ancient map and forge a path to an island where a lost civilization waits to be found. For Freddy, it's a chance to sell the story of a lifetime.\n\nBut nothing is as simple as it appears from halfway across the world. Old acquaintances become enemies, professional rivalries turn violent, and a notorious gang lord wants his map back. The island itself holds dangers that Freddy and Lumpen couldn't have prepared to faceÃ¢â‚¬â€and horrifying secrets that might be better left buried. Beset by wild beasts, cutthroat competitors, and dangers darker still, the two men fight not for glory, but their own survivalÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ before the island pushes them to the brink of insanity.\n\n-- \n\nDISCOVERING ABERRATION is a alternative history adventure novel. Inspired by the classic science fiction, adventure, and horror writers who spawned what would later become the steampunk genre, DISCOVERING ABERRATION is part Victorian era urban romp,part dark fantasy adventure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28f4e1cc2921effbccde42a4265ad5d267f75f0a","amp;dn":"Discovering+Aberration%3A+A+Steampunk+Novel+by+S.C.+Barrus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28f4e1cc2921effbccde42a4265ad5d267f75f0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,244,225,204,41,33,239,251,204,222,66,164,38,90,213,210,103,247,95,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
