Jari Litmanen is still immense popular in Holland and even more in Amsterdam. Last time when he was in Amsterdam watching a game of Ajax, all supporters start screaming his name when he was on camera on the big screens. Arto Koskinen has surprised me! Good interviews with big players and great images of the career of Jari Litmanen! Interviews with Danny Blind, Frank and Ronald de Boer, Louis van Gaal, Puyol, Steven Gerrard and many more. Even emotional images of Jari Litmanen what we've never seen before. that makes this documentary that special. I hope he will go on with football and come back to Ajax and become a (youth) trainer. Thanks for everything you brought us Jari Litmanen!&quot;\n\n-Jorg van Lokven (IMDB)\n\n\n------\n\n16:9\n1h 47 min.\nDD 5.1 / 2.0","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3823fd7dd41020275eb6faed086dda19cc063787","amp;dn":"Kuningas+Litmanen+%28King+Litmanen%29+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3823fd7dd41020275eb6faed086dda19cc063787","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,35,253,125,212,16,32,39,94,182,250,237,8,109,218,25,204,6,55,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
