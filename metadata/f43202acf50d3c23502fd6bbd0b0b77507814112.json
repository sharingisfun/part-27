Until I can\ntrack one down, I've upsized and kinda cleaned the GIFs available on the net\nusing the GIMP, but tried to retain the &quot;home-screened&quot; roghness of the\noriginal print. Saved the primary image on a transparent background in PNG \nformat, so you can use it to get your neighborhood  T-Shirt maker, Cafe Press,\netc, to screen your own. If you happen to have access to one of the originals,\nwould you consider scanning it and making a torrent?\n\n*******************************************************************************\n                               Monkey Warfare\n*******************************************************************************\n\n\nPS\nI forgot to mention, if anybody has a copy of the last episode of &quot;Man Alive&quot; (with the three devils posing as old men), I'd sure appreciate you posting it.\t\t\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f43202acf50d3c23502fd6bbd0b0b77507814112","amp;dn":"Monkey+Warfare+%28movie+plus+propaganda+pix%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f43202acf50d3c23502fd6bbd0b0b77507814112","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,50,2,172,245,13,60,35,80,47,214,187,208,176,183,117,7,129,65,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
