It was released in July, 2009. This album was released over a year after his death, and contains hits and covers. As noted by one reviewer, &quot;...the blind musician will be remembered best for playing searing guitar on his lap, looking like a pedal steel guitar man gone mad. Songs from the Road...captures Healey's gift for energizing rock and blues tunes with powerful, sometimes blistering guitar work. It's a talent that occasionally sneaks up on the listener.&quot;\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;I Think I Love You Too Much&quot;- 5:40\n    &quot;I'm Ready&quot;- 5:22\n    &quot;Stop Breaking Down&quot;- 5:58\n    &quot;Angel Eyes&quot;- 5:55\n    &quot;Come Together&quot;- 5:23\n    &quot;Hoochie Coochie Man&quot;-7:10\n    &quot;White Room&quot;- 5:36\n    &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;- 5:14\n    &quot;Whipping Post&quot;- 5:59\n    &quot;Teach Your Children Well&quot;- 2:49\n    &quot;Santa Bring My Baby Back To Me&quot;- 2:10\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba304e7ef0baf39260c66960328d85819993d2ad","amp;dn":"Jeff+Healey+-+Songs+From+The+Road+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba304e7ef0baf39260c66960328d85819993d2ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,48,78,126,240,186,243,146,96,198,105,96,50,141,133,129,153,147,210,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
