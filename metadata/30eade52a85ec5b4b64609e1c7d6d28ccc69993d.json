The person who more than other has been doomed in the history books as guilty of Che's death is his former lieutenant, Ciro Bustos.\n\nWhen captured he drew Che's portrait for the Bolivian army. Since then he has been living in silence. He now appears for the first time in a documentary film. His version of the events raises questions about how history is written.\n\nWinner of:\n\nFirst Prize at the 2001 International Documentary Filmfestival &quot;It's all true&quot;, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\nFirst Prize at the 2001 International Documentary Filmfestival of Oporto, Portugal.\n\nBest Non-Latinamerican Documentary at 2001 Festival de Nuevo Cine, Havana, Cuba.\n\nBest use of music and sound, Prague, 2002 &quot;One World&quot; Human Right Film Festival. \n\nDirected by Erik Gandini and Tarik Saleh\nCamera MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rten Nilsson and Lukas Eisenhauer\nEditing Johan SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶derberg\nProduced by Atmo for SVT Documentary\nParticipants: \nCiro Bustos (revolutionary and artist), Felix I.
