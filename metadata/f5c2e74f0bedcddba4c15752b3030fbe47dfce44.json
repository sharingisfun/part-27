Narrated by Golden Globe nominee Christopher Plummer (Best Supporting Actor, AMERICAN TRAGEDY, 2000), it?s the bold and powerful story of Jesus as told by his disciple John. The best-loved but least understood of the gospels, John presents a uniquely human portrait of courage and passion encompassing Jesus&amp;#039; entire three-year ministry, the final years of his life. Intimate and reflective, The Gospel of John offers an unparalleled opportunity to experience the incomparable life and times of Jesus Christ.\n\nCTCA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5c2e74f0bedcddba4c15752b3030fbe47dfce44","amp;dn":"Gospel+of+John+DVD+1+and+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5c2e74f0bedcddba4c15752b3030fbe47dfce44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,194,231,79,11,237,205,219,164,193,87,82,179,3,15,190,71,223,206,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
