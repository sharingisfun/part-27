You know, the story of the rock underdog. Starry-eyed band signs to major label. Band has surprise MTV hit. Band records another album. Label doesn't hear a single. Band refuses to comply. Label drops band. Band disappears, becomes jaded, and then turns fiercely indie as a big &quot;f you&quot; to its former label. The rock underdog in this case is Nada Surf, their middle finger gesture was 2003's Let Go, and they are with the fiercely indie Barsuk Records, who will release the band's next album, The Weight Is a Gift on September 20.\n\nThe album was produced by the band and Chris Walla of Death Cab for Cutie (who also performs on it). It was recorded at John Vanderslice's Tiny Telephone Studios in San Francisco and at Walla's Hall of Justice in Seattle. Continuing to hone their 60s-inflected pop sound, the new album taps into the spirit of the Moody Blues with songs such as &quot;Do It Again&quot;, &quot;All Is a Game&quot;, and &quot;Imaginary Friends&quot;. The tracklist is as follows:\n\n01 Concrete Bed\n02 Do It Again\n03 Always Love\n04 What Is Your Secret?\n05 Your Legs Grow\n06 All Is a Game\n07 Blankest Year\n08 Comes a Time\n09 In the Mirror\n10 Armies Walks\n11 Imaginary Friends\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9abb1a289e742d089f0ff1f421e2102f528ee7b","amp;dn":"Nada+Surf+-+The+Weight+Is+a+Gift+%282005%29+%5BLAME+APX%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9abb1a289e742d089f0ff1f421e2102f528ee7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,171,177,162,137,231,66,208,137,240,255,31,66,30,33,2,245,40,238,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
