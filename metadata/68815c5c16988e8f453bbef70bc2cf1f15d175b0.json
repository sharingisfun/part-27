It is also for anyone who has never grown anything before but has wondered how we will feed a growing population in a world of shrinking resources. \n\n\nAlthough a practicing scientist in the field of water and agriculture, the author has written, in story form accessible to a wide audience, about the drama of how the world feeds itself. The book starts in his own fruit and vegetable garden, exploring the &quot;how and why&quot; questions about the way things grow, before moving on to stories about soil, rivers, aquifers and irrigation. The book closes with a brief history of agriculture, how the world feeds itself today and how to think through some of the big conundrums of modern food production.\n\nFeatures\n* Gives an in-depth understanding on how plants and soil work using stories more than the language of science.\n* It is not a &quot;how to&quot; book, but a framework over which to lay your own experience, to learn and reflect.\n* Information for gardeners on the challenge of growing food and feeding a family in the city\n* Covers plants, soil and rivers and the journey from hunter-gatherer to modern agriculture\n* Reflects on the way scientists conduct their craft\n* A book for anyone interested in food, how it is grown and how the world feeds itself\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68815c5c16988e8f453bbef70bc2cf1f15d175b0","amp;dn":"Out+of+the+Scientist%5C%27s+Garden","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68815c5c16988e8f453bbef70bc2cf1f15d175b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,129,92,92,22,152,142,143,69,59,190,247,11,194,207,31,21,209,117,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
