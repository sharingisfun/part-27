Bernice's birth was the result of an infidelity on his behalf, however, and so while Detty grew up with a wealthy family, Bernice and his mother were left to fend for themselves. Years later, Bernice has become a wealthy and successful businessman, the so-called &quot;Lord of Apparels&quot;. But his abrasive personality and rudeness has led to the resignation of his 75th assistant. Detty, meanwhile, is in dire need of a job and applies for the newly vacated position as executive assistant to a man that, unbeknownst to her, is actually her half-brother. Bernice knows exactly who she is and hires her. For Detty, this job means she can take care of her daughters; for Bernice, its a chance for payback. Meanwhile, the main rival of Bernices company is currently posing as very strong competition. Headed by the eccentric yet equally brilliant &amp; talented Roselle (Kris Aquino) the competition gets tougher, and a string of events lead to the two company heads fighting over the once expendable Detty.
