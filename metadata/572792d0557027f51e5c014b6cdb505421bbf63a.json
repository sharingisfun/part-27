It is based on the work of Isuna Hasekura and the primary character illustrator is JÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â« Ayakura.\n\nWithin this image pack of around 900 images, there is included: a book of the manga, a large amount of unassorted wallpapers, animated gifs and avatars, banners, and other miscellaneous images. The vast majority of the images come from a zipped image pack posted on the /w/ board of 4chan.org by an anonymous user. The only images I am contributing are the mostly hi-res wallpapers in the folder &quot;QMDMQs Personal Stash&quot;. For images I personally collect I try to choose hi-res, well-made images, however, the sourced zip is desirable because of the immense number of Spice and Wolf images it holds, so quality is variable. \n\nTake what you choose from it, share it among friends, enjoy. It's a great show with plenty of superb artwork.\n\n-QMDMQ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:572792d0557027f51e5c014b6cdb505421bbf63a","amp;dn":"Spice+and+Wolf+Large+Image+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"572792d0557027f51e5c014b6cdb505421bbf63a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,39,146,208,85,112,39,245,30,92,1,75,108,219,80,84,33,187,246,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
