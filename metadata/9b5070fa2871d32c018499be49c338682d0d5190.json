To do so, he decides to host a big festival headlining D.A.F., positioning his band as warmup. The problem is that D.A.F decided to stop playing gigs, the Circus Krone Arena is expensive, and the whole project seems to be a little too big for him. Of course, romances, bankrobbery, fraud and a lot of New Wave - NDW music make this film a must see.\n\n\nPlease note that this film is in German with NO subtitles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b5070fa2871d32c018499be49c338682d0d5190","amp;dn":"Verschwende.Deine.Jugend.DVD.Rip.XviD.by.ottomane.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b5070fa2871d32c018499be49c338682d0d5190","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,80,112,250,40,113,211,44,1,132,153,190,73,195,56,104,45,13,81,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
