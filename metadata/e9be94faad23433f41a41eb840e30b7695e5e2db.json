After fifteen months of captivity, finally... she is free.\n\nTWO FRIENDS\nSelf-made millionaires JD and Ark are not out to save anyone when they stumble upon a wet and shivering girl one early Sunday morning. But when you sell sex for a living and salvation rings your bell... you answer the call.\n\nTHREE SOULMATES\nAfter years of searching, love lifts the veil of darkness, and three people--with three very big secrets--find themselves bound together in a relationship that defies the odds.\n\nOr does it?\n\nLove. Lust. Sex.\n\nThis trinity might be perfection... but not everything should come in 3's","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9be94faad23433f41a41eb840e30b7695e5e2db","amp;dn":"Three%2C+Two%2C+One+by+J.A.+Huss+ePub+-+Xetron","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9be94faad23433f41a41eb840e30b7695e5e2db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,190,148,250,173,35,67,63,65,164,30,184,64,227,11,118,149,229,226,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
