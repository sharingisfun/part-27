Infrequently performed, the work is actually better than history would have us believe and deserves to be more popular. The Triple Concerto receives loving treatment on this new recording which is notable for the synchronicity shared by the three soloists. The trio triumphs because they are at complete ease with all of the work&amp;#039;s shifting moods. They soar in full-voiced splendor in the heroic opening Allegro, sing with chamber music-like intimacy in the pensive Largo, and dance in the rambunctious Rondo alla polacca finale.\n\nIf the Triple Concerto is an oddity then the Piano Concerto in D major op.61a is certainly Beethoven&amp;#039;s bastard child. Commissioned by the pianist/publisher Muzio Clementi in 1807, the work is an adaptation of the Violin Concerto written in 1806. Pianist JenÃƒÂ¶ JandÃƒÂ³ is an ideal performer for this music and his Mozartean conception of the work is completely successful. JandÃƒÂ³ is ably supported by the Nicolaus EsterhÃƒÂ¡zy Sinfonia under the direction of BÃƒÂ©la Drahos. While none of these performers are household names, they are skilled Beethoven interpreters deserving wider recognition.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd0b8158f68ff9160e0dcfc78ea1234e870169bb","amp;dn":"Beethoven%3A+Triple+Concerto%2C+Op.+56+%26+Violin+Concerto%2C+Op.+61a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd0b8158f68ff9160e0dcfc78ea1234e870169bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,11,129,88,246,143,249,22,14,13,207,199,142,161,35,78,135,1,105,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
