From his 1st recordings for the label with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, it was clear that Lou Donaldson put melody &amp; sound at a premium, coming up with an amalgam that combined the creamy smoothness of Johnny Hodges with the quicksilver bop inflections of Charlie Parker.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01. Lou's Blues\n 02. Be My Love\n 03. Idaho\n 04. The Nearness Of You\n 05. Mack The Knife\n 06. Crosstown Shuffle\n 07.
