Rufus Fears,University of Oklahoma\n\nIn this companion course to Famous Greeks inspired this time by the works of Livy, Polybius, Suetonius, and Tacitus as well as the indispensable PlutarchÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Professor J. Rufus Fears retells the lives of the statesmen and thinkers who shaped Rome from its rise to world power in the struggle against Carthage to the decline of the Empire after Marcus Aurelius. \nFrom the heroes of the early Republic introduced to you by Professor Fears through an imaginary tour of the Forum as it appeared in 218 B.C. to the Stoic emperor Marcus Aurelius (d. A.D. 180), Professor Fears tells the gripping story of how the Romans won an empire at great cost to their own liberty, and then blazed paths that Western civilization would follow for the next 1,500 years. \n\nYou will find Professor Fears amply versed in contemporary archaeology and historical scholarship. He draws on both freely. Yet he remains closest in spirit to the classical authors who are our best sources for this tale: Livy, Polybius, Suetonius, Tacitus, and above all, Plutarch. \n\n\nThis course works well in any format. The DVD and videotape versions contain more than 350 maps, photographs, portraits, and other images to enhance the lectures as visual presentations.\n\n \nPart I\n\nLecture 1: Publius Cornelius Scipio\n\nLecture 2: Hannibal \n\nLecture 3: Gaius Flaminius \n\nLecture 4: Quintus Fabius Maximus \n\nLecture 5: Scipio Africanus the Elder \n\nLecture 6: Scipio the Younger \n\nLecture 7: Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus \n\nLecture 8: Crassus \n\nLecture 9: Gaius Julius Caesar \n\nLecture 10: Caesar and Vercingetorix\n\nLecture 11: Pompey the Great \n\nLecture 12: Cato the Younger\n\n\nPart II\n\nLecture 13: Brutus and the Opposition to Caesar\n\nLecture 14: Cicero \n\nLecture 15: Augustus \n\nLecture 16: Vergil\n\nLecture 17: Claudius \n\nLecture 18: Nero \n\nLecture 19: Trajan \n\nLecture 20: Hadrian\n\nLecture 21: Epictetus \n\nLecture 22: Apuleius\n\nLecture 23: Plutarch, Suetonius, and Tacitus\n\nLecture 24: Marcus Aurelius \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:018595b5f7fee63f6630d61a297d69f70bafcde1","amp;dn":"J.+Rufus+Fears+-++Famous+Romans","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"018595b5f7fee63f6630d61a297d69f70bafcde1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,133,149,181,247,254,230,63,102,48,214,26,41,125,105,247,11,175,205,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
