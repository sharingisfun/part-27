Issue one also contains the first two printed Milkmaid side-stories: &quot;Mission of Mercy&quot; and &quot;Milkmaid at the Con&quot;. As a bonus, Kris Overstreet's &quot;The Magnicifcent Milkmaid Writer's Bible&quot; is included, which contains information on the characters and summaries of each issue (including ones that haven't been, and may never be released).\n\nIssues 1 and 2 were found scanned on the internet, and the rest were saved from the website. I took the liberty of making them cbr files. If you'd just like the images themselves, rename the file extension .rar instead of .cbr, and just unrar the images.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c11e4e76d45920eddad6b9a0f82955781e616773","amp;dn":"The+Magnificent+Milkmaid+%28%231-6%2C+Omakes%2C+Writer%5C%27s+Bible%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c11e4e76d45920eddad6b9a0f82955781e616773","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,30,78,118,212,89,32,237,218,214,185,160,248,41,85,120,30,97,103,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
