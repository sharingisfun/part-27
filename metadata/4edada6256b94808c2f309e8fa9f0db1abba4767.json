Futures\n\nGold Leaves is a new project of Grant Olsen, half of Seattle folk duo Arthur &amp; Yu, but GLÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut release The Ornament was four years in the making. After scratching sessions for a straightforward country or R&amp;B-flavored album, the singer/songwriter hooked up with PapercutsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Jason Quever to produce a campfire-ready collection of honey-voiced, subtly orchestrated Americana. Take a listen to the Fleet Foxy roots rock of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cruel/Kind,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ along with the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more Ã¢â‚¬â„¢60s-nodding title track.\n\nGrant Olsen, the Arthur portion of SeattleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Arthur &amp; Yu, is gearing up to release his debut solo album. Using the moniker Gold Leaves, Olsen will release his album, The Ornament, on the Hardly Art label on August 16th. From the sound of the first single, also called Ã¢â‚¬Å“The OrnamentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Gold LeavesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ music lands solidly in the psychedelic indie-pop singer/songwriter vein, and the results are pretty impressive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4edada6256b94808c2f309e8fa9f0db1abba4767","amp;dn":"Gold+Leaves+-+The+Ornament+%5B2011%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4edada6256b94808c2f309e8fa9f0db1abba4767","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,218,218,98,86,185,72,8,194,243,9,232,250,159,13,177,171,186,71,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
