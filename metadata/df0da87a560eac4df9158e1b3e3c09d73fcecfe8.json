The band's music is a fusion of many different styles, including industrial, techno, ambient, experimental, funk and country music. The band name is a reference to &quot;kissing and cuddling,&quot; and Thrussell has stated that the name symbolizes the Marxist concept of destroying barriers between people. Thrussell's songs frequently contain themes of anti-capitalism, anti-fascism, anti-consumerism, individuality and anti-big-brotherism.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df0da87a560eac4df9158e1b3e3c09d73fcecfe8","amp;dn":"Snog+-+Beyond+the+Valley+of+the+Proles+2003+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df0da87a560eac4df9158e1b3e3c09d73fcecfe8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,13,168,122,86,14,172,77,249,21,142,27,62,60,9,215,63,206,207,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
