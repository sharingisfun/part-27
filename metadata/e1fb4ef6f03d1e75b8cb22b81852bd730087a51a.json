The original single was banned by the BBC because of the controversial cover, featuring an individual (Stewart Copeland) who has hanged himself standing on a large ice cube, waiting for it to melt. (An alternate cover was released in some places.) \n\nTwo music videos exist for the song. One features the group playing the song on stage of what looks to be a soundcheck of a show with Sting wearing goofy glasses. The second features the group performing the song in front of a red backdrop. This was filmed on the same day as the red backdropped version of &quot;Roxanne.&quot;\n\n\nThis video is the group performing the song in front of a red backdrop.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1fb4ef6f03d1e75b8cb22b81852bd730087a51a","amp;dn":"The+Police+-+I+Can%5C%27t+Stand+Losing+You","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1fb4ef6f03d1e75b8cb22b81852bd730087a51a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,251,78,246,240,61,30,117,184,203,34,184,24,82,189,115,0,135,165,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
