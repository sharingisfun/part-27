It is a natural sequel to the foundational paper on A1-homotopy theory written together with V. Voevodsky. Inspired by classical results in algebraic topology, we present new techniques, new results and applications related to the properties and computations of A1-homotopy sheaves, A1-homology sheaves, and sheaves with generalized transfers, as well as to algebraic vector bundles over affine smooth varieties.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a07bdc449899e322b3f508e54e2d1b4c992139c6","amp;dn":"A1-Algebraic+Topology+over+a+Field%2C+F.+Morel+%282012%29+%5B3642295134%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a07bdc449899e322b3f508e54e2d1b4c992139c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,123,220,68,152,153,227,34,179,245,8,229,78,45,27,76,153,33,57,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
