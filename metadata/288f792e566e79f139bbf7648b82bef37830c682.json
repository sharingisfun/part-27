There are plenty of individual heroics and mood variation for\nvariety with the most exciting moments are when the full quintet jams together\nat its most passionate. The five musicians had never played together before as a\ngroup and did not even rehearse before the recording began. Particularly strong\nare Joe McPhee's soprano solos and the wild playing of trombonist Steve Swell\neven if the final number, &quot;All Is Always Now,&quot; ends a bit inconclusively. All\nfive players were clearly inspired by the setting and the opportunity to play\nwith each other, and Paul Flaherty deserves credit for gathering these musicians\ntogether.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:288f792e566e79f139bbf7648b82bef37830c682","amp;dn":"Jumala+Quintet+-+Turtle+Crossing+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"288f792e566e79f139bbf7648b82bef37830c682","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,143,121,46,86,110,121,241,57,187,247,100,139,130,190,243,120,48,198,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
