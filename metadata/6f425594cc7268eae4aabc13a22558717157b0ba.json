She was the younger sister of the singer and activist Joan Baez.\n\n&quot;American folk music was a powerful popular force in the early 1960s, and for a time Baez and Bob Dylan were the anointed darlings of the folk world. The Farinas, naturally, were intimately connected with the prince and princess, and that extraordinary period was eventually chronicled by David Hajdu in the book, Positively Fourth Street: The Lives and Times of Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Mimi Baez Farina and Richard Farina (2001). In 1964 the players could hardly have known how great their impact would be, but excitement was surely in the air.\n\nThe Farinas released their first album, Celebrations for a Grey Day , in April of 1965. The original material included such enduring folk classics as Pack Up Your Sorrows , and the album became a big hit. They performed at the Newport Folk Festival that summer, where they won a standing ovation in spite of the torrential rain. In December, Reflections in a Crystal Wind was released. On it, Farina debuted her own composition, Miles , which was an instrumental tribute to jazz great Miles Davis. The couple may not have been certifiable folk royalty quite yet, but they were most certainly stars.\n\nLife appeared to be looking up even further in the spring of 1966. Farina's husband had just had his first novel, Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up To Me , published, and book signings were the order of the day. But the couple's optimism and joy was rudely cut short on April 30, when Richard was killed in a motorcycle accident. It was Farina's 21st birthday.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f425594cc7268eae4aabc13a22558717157b0ba","amp;dn":"Mimi+%26amp%3B+Richard+Fari%26ntilde%3Ba+%26lrm%3B-+Memories+%281968%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f425594cc7268eae4aabc13a22558717157b0ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,66,85,148,204,114,104,234,228,170,188,19,162,37,88,113,113,87,176,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
