Every season we do something a little different, and this time itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all about the sweet things in life. Get ready in week one as twenty pastry chef hopefuls and dessert connoisseurs compete for the thirteen coveted workspaces in our Burned kitchen. With stakes this big, we ask the one question on everyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mind: Do these chefs have what it takes to rise to the top? Or will they get Burned?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nBurned contestants Chase and Kai are attracted from the start and canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wait to spend more time getting to know each otherÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ until they see the first episode treatment and realize the producers intend to portray them as bitter enemies. At first itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fun to pretend to bickerÃ¢â‚¬â€enemies on film, lovers when the cameras stop rollingÃ¢â‚¬â€but soon itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard not to take the faux rivalry seriously. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only when their choice is to band together and bake their way to the final or get burned that they find where their real loyalties lie","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:653aa27310d4c37e120377806bc81ff9988393a3","amp;dn":"Souffl%26eacute%3Bs+at+Sunrise+-+M.J.+O%27Shea+%26amp%3B+Anna+Martin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"653aa27310d4c37e120377806bc81ff9988393a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,58,162,115,16,212,195,126,18,3,119,128,107,200,31,249,152,131,147,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
