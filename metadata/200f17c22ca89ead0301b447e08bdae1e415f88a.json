Can you live happily without money? In the documentary Ã¢â‚¬Å“Living Without MoneyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, we meet the German woman Heidemarie Schwermer (68) who made a deliberate choice to live without money 14 years ago. One day she cancelled her flat, donated all of her belongings and started a new life based on exchanging favors Ã¢â‚¬â€œ without the use of money. The experiences she made totally changed her outlook on life. Today she is living an interesting and adventurous life, which is very much related to living in the moment without worrying about the future. She is constantly on the move and always trying to help others find their path towards a more simple and harmonic life. The reactions against her are many and various. While some get angry and call her a parasite, others think she is a visionary and a great source of inspiration.\n\nThe film reflects around themes of materialism and over-consumption - how money\ninfluences our way of thinking, living and acting Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the consequences this has on our life, health and the environment.\n\nwww.livingwithoutmoney.org ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:200f17c22ca89ead0301b447e08bdae1e415f88a","amp;dn":"Living+Without+Money","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"200f17c22ca89ead0301b447e08bdae1e415f88a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,15,23,194,44,168,158,173,3,1,180,71,224,139,218,225,228,21,248,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
