This practical reference provides basic information and practical applications for the potential uses of various films in food packaging, describes the different types of microbial targets (fungal, bacteria, etc.), and focuses on the applicability of techniques to industry.\r\n\r\nTactics on the monitoring of microbial activity that use antimicrobial packaging detection of food borne pathogens, the use of biosensors, and testing antimicrobial susceptibility are also included, along with food safety and good manufacturing practices. The book aims to curtail the development of microbiological contamination of food through anti-microbial packaging to improve the safety in the food supply chain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPresents the science behind anti-microbial packaging and films reflecting advancements in chemistry, microbiology, and food science\r\nIncludes the most up-to-date information on regulatory aspects, consumer acceptance, research trends, cost analysis, risk analysis and quality control\r\nDiscusses the uses of natural and unnatural compounds for food safety and defense","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0418844b6f774ab4534f85160ccd9483eb93c1b0","amp;dn":"Antimicrobial+Food+Packaging","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0418844b6f774ab4534f85160ccd9483eb93c1b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,24,132,75,111,119,74,180,83,79,133,22,12,205,148,131,235,147,193,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
