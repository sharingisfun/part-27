Evidently it's nickname is California's Country Music Capital, or Nashville West (I've lived in California for 2/3 of my life and I've never heard such a thing. But then I don't listen to country music, either).\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakersfield,_California&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakersfield,_California&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBakersfield is a major city near the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley in \nKern County, California.
