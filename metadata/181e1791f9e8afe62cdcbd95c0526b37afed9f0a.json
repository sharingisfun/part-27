This is in a pdf format and is very detailed. This is not the owners manual which tells you next to nothing. This is the manual factory mechanics use. As these bikes are very similar download them both if you are working on a DT200. The DT125 is the main manual here. I couldn't find one on the net so I bought it and created it. This is in English. As always seed if you're going to use torrents or I'll send my buddies around.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:181e1791f9e8afe62cdcbd95c0526b37afed9f0a","amp;dn":"Yamaha+DT200+Dt125","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"181e1791f9e8afe62cdcbd95c0526b37afed9f0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,30,23,145,249,232,175,230,44,220,189,149,192,82,107,55,175,237,159,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
