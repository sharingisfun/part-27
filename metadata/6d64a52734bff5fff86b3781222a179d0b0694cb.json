Offit.epub\n\nIn 2010, California suffered the largest and deadliest outbreak of pertussis, also known as Ã¢â‚¬Å“whooping cough,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in more than fifty years. This tragedy was avoidable. An effective vaccine has been available since the 1940s. In recent years other diseases, like measles and mumps, have also made a comeback. The reason for these epidemics can be traced to a group whose vocal proponents insist, despite evidence to the contrary, that vaccines are poison. As a consequence, parents and caretakers are rejecting vaccines for themselves and their families.\n\nIn Deadly Choices, infectious-disease expert Paul Offit takes a look behind the curtain of the anti-vaccine movement. What he finds is a reminder of the power of scientific knowledge, and the harm we risk if we ignore it.\n\n288 pages\nPublisher: Basic Books; 1 edition (December 28, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0465021492\nISBN-13: 978-0465021499","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d64a52734bff5fff86b3781222a179d0b0694cb","amp;dn":"Deadly+Choices%3A+The+Anti-Vaccine+Movement+Threatens+Us+All","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d64a52734bff5fff86b3781222a179d0b0694cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,100,165,39,52,191,245,255,248,107,55,129,34,42,23,157,11,6,148,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
