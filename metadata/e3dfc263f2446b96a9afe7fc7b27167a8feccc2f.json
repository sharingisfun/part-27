Yes, all those years you were told not to sit too close to the television (you\u0019ll hurt your eyes!) or swallow your gum (it stays in your stomach for seven years!) or crack your knuckles (arthritis!) are called into question by our country\u0019s leading trivia guru. Jennings separates myth from fact to debunk a wide variety of parental edicts: no swimming after meals, sit up straight, don\u0019t talk to strangers, and so on. \n\nArmed with medical case histories, scientific findings, and even the occasional experiment on himself (or his kids), Jennings exposes countless examples of parental wisdom run amok. Whether you\u0019re a parent who wants to know what you can stop worrying about or a kid (of any age) looking to say, \u001cI told you so,\u001d this is the anti\u0013helicopter parenting book you\u0019ve been waiting for.
