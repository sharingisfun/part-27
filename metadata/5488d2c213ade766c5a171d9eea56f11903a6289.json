If the first album was the statement, and the second was the experiment, this one would be the masterpiece. Released on January 25th, 2011 as a 320kbps MP3 download on the Rain Music Group label (and on October 8th of that same year as FLAC), it represents years of growth, but it didn't come without its fair share of setbacks. Originally planned to be a 2009 release, multiple wrenches in the gears caused this album to finally be completed at the end of 2010 and released right after the dawn of a brand new year. More layered, twice the length, and chock full of more sonic experimentation than the last two full-length efforts, Pressure &amp; Obsession takes you on a journey of a failed rebirth. A story with no words, only sound.\n\nwww.ruinedmachines.com\nruinedmachines.bandcamp.com\nruinedmachines.spreadshirt.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5488d2c213ade766c5a171d9eea56f11903a6289","amp;dn":"Ruined+Machines+-+Pressure+%26amp%3B+Obsession+%282011%29+320+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5488d2c213ade766c5a171d9eea56f11903a6289","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,136,210,194,19,173,231,102,197,161,113,217,238,165,111,17,144,58,98,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
