One of the most important achievements of the past millennium, it did for biology what Galileo did for astronomy: made it into a single science rather than a collection of unrelated facts. Important though Origin remains, its examples and intricate Victorian prose are now a century and a half old. They are ripe for renewal and reaffirmation. Writing as &quot;Darwin's ghost,&quot; eminent geneticist Steve Jones updates this seminal workâ€”and restates evolution's case for the 21st century.\r\n\r\nJones is a writer of engaging wit and dazzling erudition and has been called &quot;the British Carl Sagan.&quot; Using modern examplesâ€”the AIDS virus, the puzzles of sexual selection, the physiology and psychology of pets, and the unparalleled genetic success of our own speciesâ€”he shows the power and immediacy of Darwin's great argument and makes us appreciate how it makes life make sense. Eye-opening and entertaining, filled with astonishing facts, amusing anecdotes, and the very latest research, Darwin's Ghost is contemporary science writing at its very best","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8799235d2b0f11f29436c04f2aa6c08acbed5193","amp;dn":"Darwin%27s+Ghost+-+The+Origin+of+the+Species+Updated+-+Steve+Jones","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8799235d2b0f11f29436c04f2aa6c08acbed5193","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,153,35,93,43,15,17,242,148,54,192,79,42,166,192,138,203,237,81,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
