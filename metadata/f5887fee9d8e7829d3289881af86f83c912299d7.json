To this mix DeFalco added Night Thrasher, an original character to serve as the team's founder and leader. The first volume was cancelled after 75 issues.\n\nA short-lived relaunch began in 1999 and ran for 11 issues. Original members Namorita, Nova, and Speedball were joined by returning member Turbo and new members Bolt and Aegis. The last was an all-new character, reminiscent of Night Thrasher being the only new character among the original team. A promotional issue #0 was given away with Wizard Magazine.\n\nSpeedball tries to assemble a new team after they disbanded between the first and second volume, but initially fails. Nova and Namorita arrive to cheer him up when they are called in to fight Blastaar, and they are quickly aided by Turbo, Justice, Firestar, Bolt, and new hero Aegis. Although Justice and Firestar decline to rejoin the team, the other heroes agree to reform the New Warriors. Shortly thereafter, they fight the Eugenix group, who try to kill Namorita for being a clone.
