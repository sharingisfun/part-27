That may seem a bit strange, because theirs is a more teen-oriented fare, and teenagers are a fleeting audience (until they hit 40 and get nostalgic), but when it comes to longevity, the group can be compared to Linkin Park, who have also managed to outlast their initial success by the simple quality of their music. There is a difference, of course: the Americans stay relevant by constantly reinventing nu metal, and the Rasmus stick to the one thing the Finns generally do best, which is writing hard rock-based, highly melodic songs that reflect the country's moody climate. In fact, the Rasmus have been doing this all along, slowly edging to the top as they shifted from punkier fare to a goth-rooted sound, and their approach is in its full dark bloom on Black Roses, which shows that the band is no one-hit wonder -- one-style wonder maybe, but no less than that. The album isn't really different from a couple of its predecessors (much like the case with those unchanging classic rockers), but it also carries not a single filler track, being loaded with ÃƒÂ¼ber-catchy riffs that combine genuine seriousness with a certain irresistible bouncy quality -- there's no way to get &quot;Livin' in a World Without You&quot; out of your head once it's played a couple of times, and the rest is only a notch behind. Lauri YlÃƒÂ¶nen's voice is still weepy, but that's what the Rasmus are about, anyway. The whole thing is simple and predictable, but the album's blend of energy and unashamed sentimentality is exemplary for the band's own sound and for Finnish rock in general, and this is a sign of quality: after all, being catchy is hard work, and not many can floor it both so well and so steadily.\nAll Music Review by Alexey Eremenko.\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Livin' In A World Without You\n[02] Ten Black Roses\n[03] Ghost Of Love\n[04] Justify\n[05] Your Forgiveness\n[06] Run To You\n[07] You Got It Wrong\n[08] Lost And Lonely\n[09] The Fight\n[10] Dangerous Kind\n[11] Live Forever\n[12] Yesterday You Threw Away Tomorrow\n\nPlay Time - 00h:45m:35s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 117mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
