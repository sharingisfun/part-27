Girls' short career arc went from scrappy, reverb-drowned eccentrics to majestic psych-prog-tinged rock, but his first effort finds Owens stripping back on both reverb and majesty in favor of a more organic, intimate sound. Split between confessional, Baroque folk ballads and bubbly rockers, the brief album traces the splintering of a love affair with all the melodic strength and clunky lyrical style associated with OwensÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ previous work. He sounds more comfortable laying back in the ballads this time out, surrounding his ultra-plaintive vocals with a comforting array of acoustic guitars, vibraphones, electric pianos, and female backing vocals. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Here We GoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Everywhere We KnewÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are very sweet songs that show a nicely tender side to OwensÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ quirky persona, and the bouncy title track sounds like something twee and happy enough for Donovan to take a crack at. The uptempo songs are less successful, sounding a bit forced and, in the case of the otherwise enjoyable Ã¢â‚¬Å“New York City,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ overpowered by a tiresomely honking saxophone break that should have been dragged to the recycle bin during mixdown. In more bad news, the meandering bar band reggae instrumental Ã¢â‚¬Å“Riveria RockÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ does nothing but pad the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s running time. The other two short instrumental pieces are pleasant but inessential as well. Really what this album should have been was a five-song EP made up of ballads, since they are where OwensÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ strength lies. As it stands, the album is a decent attempt at a fresh start that wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t put off too many Girls fans, but until he figures out exactly what kind of singer/songwriter he wants to be, wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t likely earn him too many new fans.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43ad011318edf65d252b19dd3952f66f73d868c9","amp;dn":"Christopher+Owens+-+Lysandre+%5B2013%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43ad011318edf65d252b19dd3952f66f73d868c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,173,1,19,24,237,246,93,37,43,25,221,57,82,246,111,115,216,104,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
