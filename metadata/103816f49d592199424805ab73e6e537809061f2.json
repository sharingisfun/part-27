He began his career as part of London's pub rock scene in the early 1970s and later became associated with the first wave of the British punk and new wave movement of the mid-to-late 1970s. His critically acclaimed debut album, My Aim Is True, was recorded in 1977. Shortly after recording his first album he formed the Attractions as his backing band. His second album, This Year's Model, was released in 1978, and was ranked number 11 by Rolling Stone on its list of the best albums from 1967Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1987. His third album, Armed Forces, was released in 1979, and features his most successful single &quot;Oliver's Army&quot;. His first three albums all appeared on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\nCostello and the Attractions toured and recorded together for the better part of a decade, though differences between them caused a split by 1986. Much of Costello's work since has been as a solo artist, though reunions with members of the Attractions have been credited to the group over the years. Steeped in wordplay, the vocabulary of Costello's lyrics is broader than that of most popular songs. His music has drawn on many diverse genres; one critic described him as a &quot;pop encyclopaedia&quot;, able to &quot;reinvent the past in his own image&quot;.\n\nCostello has won multiple awards in his career, including a Grammy Award, and has twice been nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Male. In 2003, Costello and the Attractions were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked Costello number 80 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis Year's Model is Elvis Costello's second album and his first with the Attractions, released in 1978. It was mainly recorded at Eden Studios in West London.\n\nIt was voted the best album of the year in The Village Voice Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll. In 2000, Q magazine placed This Year's Model at number 82 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. In 1987, Rolling Stone magazine ranked it number 11 on its list of the best albums of the period 1967Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1987. In 2003, the album was ranked number 98 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonnel:\n\n\nElvis Costello: guitar, vocals\nSteve Nieve: piano, organ\nBruce Thomas: bass\nPete Thomas: drums\nMick Jones: lead guitar on &quot;Big Tears&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:103816f49d592199424805ab73e6e537809061f2","amp;dn":"Elvis+Costello+-+This+Year%27s+Model+%5B1978%5D%5B2002%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"103816f49d592199424805ab73e6e537809061f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,56,22,244,157,89,33,153,66,72,5,171,115,230,229,55,128,144,97,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
