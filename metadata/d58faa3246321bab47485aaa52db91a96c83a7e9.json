While some may say this is old-fashioned, today it's hard to argue with Romans' view.\nSmart is the New Rich explores how adopting a new approach to money can lead to a healthier financial lifestyle. Each chapter opens with a question about money to begin the conversation about earning, saving, spending, growing, and protecting your money. Using checklists and quizzes, Romans guides you through the &quot;New Normal,&quot; helping you to think differently about your money and relearning good habits for prosperity...............","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d58faa3246321bab47485aaa52db91a96c83a7e9","amp;dn":"Smart+is+the+New+Rich-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d58faa3246321bab47485aaa52db91a96c83a7e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,143,170,50,70,50,27,171,71,72,90,170,82,219,145,169,108,131,167,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
