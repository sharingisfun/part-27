ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a sweeping narrative about fathers and sons, the movie business, and the sundry sea changes that have shaped Hollywood and, by extension, American life.\n\nBeau RosenwaldÃ¢â‚¬â€overweight, not particularly handsome, and improbably charismaticÃ¢â‚¬â€arrives in Los Angles in 1962 with nothing but an ill-fitting suit and a pair of expensive brogues. By the late 1970s he has helped found the most successful agency in Hollywood. Through the eyes of his son, we watch Beau and his partner go to war, waging a seismic battle that redraws the lines of an entire industry. \n\nWe watch Beau rise and fall and rise again, in accordance with the cultural transformations that dictate the fickle world of movies. We watch Beau's partner, the enigmatic and cerebral Williams Farquarsen, struggle to contain himself, to control his impulses and consolidate his power. \n\nAnd we watch two generations of men fumble and thrive across the LA landscape, learning for themselves the shadows and costs exacted by success and failure. Mammalian, funny, and filled with characters both vital and profound, American Dream Machine is a piercing interrogation of the roleÃ¢â‚¬â€nourishing, as well as destructiveÃ¢â‚¬â€that illusion plays in all our lives.\n\nGenre: General Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aac9ca926a12fece2aeb466aff32ea8b0e0c4ef3","amp;dn":"American+Dream+Machine+by+Matthew+Specktor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aac9ca926a12fece2aeb466aff32ea8b0e0c4ef3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,201,202,146,106,18,254,206,42,235,70,106,255,50,234,139,14,12,78,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
