The band's debut full-length, The Airing of Grievances (which makes reference to a Seinfeld episode), was first released by Troubleman Unlimited in 2008, then picked up for wider distribution by XL Recordings in January 2009. For the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impressive 2010 follow-up, The Monitor, Titus Andronicus beefed up the production value and enlisted the help of musicians from ten other indie acts, including members of the Hold Steady, Vivian Girls, and Ponytail.  Local Business followed in 2012.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6d2bb01d2dba408297676e4ec291c9c75cc6af3","amp;dn":"Titus+Andronicus+-+Local+Business+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6d2bb01d2dba408297676e4ec291c9c75cc6af3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,210,187,1,210,219,164,8,41,118,118,228,236,41,28,156,117,204,106,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
