This study explores these theories in a variety of intellectual settings, challenging our view of modern science as a straightforward successor to Aristotelian natural philosophy. It shows how astronomers dealt with celestial novelties by deploying old ideas in new ways and identifying more subtle notions of cosmic rationality. Beginning with the celestial spheres of Peurbach and ending with the evolutionary implications of the new star Mira Ceti, it surveys a pivotal phase in our understanding of the universe as a place of constant change that confirmed deeper patterns of cosmic order and stability.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 230 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (December 1, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 9400700369\n    * ISBN-13: 978-9400700369","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c53e953b536ce9fce35184ae30c105bcb020bf1c","amp;dn":"Change+and+Continuity+in+Early+Modern+Cosmology+%28Archimedes%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c53e953b536ce9fce35184ae30c105bcb020bf1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,62,149,59,83,108,233,252,227,81,132,174,48,193,5,188,176,32,191,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
