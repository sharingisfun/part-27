Will There Be Any\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s probably no shock for Todd Snider followers to discover that he was/is heavily influenced by veteran gonzo country singer/songwriter Jerry Jeff Walker. Snider has been carrying on WalkerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s scraggly Texas-styled country/Americana tradition since he started, without specifically acknowledging itÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ until now. He and some musical friends along with co-producer to the stars Don Was, kick back and sling out 14 Walker tracks that range from the iconic (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mr. BojanglesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½/Ã¢â‚¬Å“Railroad LadyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) to the relatively obscure (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Vince Triple-O MartinÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) with the same laconic/scrappy vibe that has defined WalkerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own music over the past 45 years. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clearly a labor of love but should also help WalkerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tunes (and extensive career) get discovered by SniderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s younger, hipper fan base.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b16ce7a60e2e20a749f752d5dc031a2b02777e6","amp;dn":"Todd+Snider+-+Time+As+We+Know+It%3A+The+Songs+of+Jerry+Jeff+Walker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b16ce7a60e2e20a749f752d5dc031a2b02777e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,22,206,122,96,226,226,10,116,159,117,45,93,192,49,162,176,39,119,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
