Although Candlebox ... Full Descriptionhail from Seattle, their style is not as dour or dirty-sounding as their grunge brethren. Musically, they straddle the gap between the glam metal of the late '80s and the Pacific Northwest sound that came roaring to the top of the charts in the early '90s. Kevin Martin's singing has a rasp that lends itself well to the minimal angst that permeates these songs, whether it's the desperation that comes with seeing a loved one slide into an abyss of drug addiction in &quot;You&quot; or the prequel of initial abandonment that is &quot;Far Behind.&quot; \n\nContrasting these low-key numbers are rockers like &quot;Arrow&quot; and &quot;Don't You&quot; that howl with Peter Klett's aggressive leads. There are even mellower pastiches of jazz (&quot;No Sense&quot;) and low-key blues (&quot;Rain&quot;) showing Candlebox to be a band ignoring the conservative parameters of hard rock. \n\nAtypical of the modern rock climate, Candlebox represents a long untapped corner of Seattle's music scene, and has found success on its own terms--without the benefit of flannel. \nAll songs written or co-written by Candlebox. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:671a6757dec97145cf465f048d78e82a3f3005c7","amp;dn":"Candlebox+-+Candlebox+%28EAC.FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"671a6757dec97145cf465f048d78e82a3f3005c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,26,103,87,222,201,113,69,207,70,95,4,141,120,232,42,63,48,5,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
