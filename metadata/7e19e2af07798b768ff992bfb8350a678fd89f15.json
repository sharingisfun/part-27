For nearly two months, strange flying objects visit the island--some big, some small, saucer-shaped, cigar-shaped, some luminous and some not. Witnesses report they felt as if blood had been sucked from them by the strange rays. More than 30 residents suffer puncture wounds or burns after their encounters. Two islanders reportedly die from their injuries. The Brazilian Air Force sends a task force to the island for three months and it returns with 300 night photos and several motion picture reels. Though a 500-page report is compiled, along with a catalogue of the sightings, maps, and interview \ntranscripts, it's kept from the public. Then, in May 2005, a few of the details are released, but many questions go unanswered. In this unique hour, we examine these mysterious happenings in depth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e19e2af07798b768ff992bfb8350a678fd89f15","amp;dn":"%5BHistory+Channel%5D+UFO+Files+-+Brazil%5C%27s+Roswell.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e19e2af07798b768ff992bfb8350a678fd89f15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,25,226,175,7,121,139,118,143,249,146,191,184,53,10,103,143,216,159,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
