The song was written by Kesha, Pebe Sebert, with Ammo, who co-produced the song with Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco. It was released on April 20, 2010, as the album's third single. The main idea behind the song is being so in love with someone that you lose your head, comparable to love being a drug.\nThe music video for the song was directed by Honey. It was shot on April 6 and April 7, 2010 in the Lancaster, California desert. The video premiered on Vevo at 12:01 a.m. on May 13, 2010.\n\n\nPlot\n\nThis video was inspired by the Beatles' Yellow Submarine movie, the animation aspect. There's a little bit of [that] in there too. The video begins with Kesha waking up next to her love interest; she then proceeds to run away while being chased by the man. They are later seen on a boat singing while digitally animated water is added, it then cuts to a scene of all animation. The video then cuts to another scene where Kesha is covered in glow in the dark body paint while dancing around in a cave with a python around her neck. The video ends with Kesha and her lover sitting around a campfire while still in the desert.\n\n\nDetails\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 98.2 MiB\nDuration                         : 3mn 28s\nOverall bit rate                 : 3 953 Kbps\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : xvid\nDuration                         : 3mn 28s\nBit rate                         : 3,619 Kbps\nWidth                            : 1,008 pixels\nHeight                           : 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 30.000 fps\nStream size                      : 89.9 MiB (92%)\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nDuration                         : 3mn 28s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 7.95 MiB (8%)\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.72 video frame)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c671ff5e275eb40b0cdc919c1b2d3d66dbc38b5c","amp;dn":"Your+Love+Is+My+Drug+-+Ke%24ha+%5Bmildpoison%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c671ff5e275eb40b0cdc919c1b2d3d66dbc38b5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,113,255,94,39,94,180,11,12,220,145,156,27,45,61,102,219,195,139,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
