Re-appropriating a traditionally male genre, the film's female perspective highlights the inequality between the sexes during the period, whilst also showing the girls to be worthy adversaries to their male counterparts. With its lush recreation of the era, Cantet's film continues in the vein of such films as Rebel Without a Cause and The Outsiders.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:093aca5829539a72420f6501c424eb151a935882","amp;dn":"Foxfire+2012+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"093aca5829539a72420f6501c424eb151a935882","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,58,202,88,41,83,154,114,66,15,101,1,196,36,235,21,26,147,88,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
