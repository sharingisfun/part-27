Opeth is a Swedish progressive metal band from Stockholm, formed in 1990. Though the group has been through several personnel changes, singer, guitarist, and songwriter Mikael Ãƒâ€¦kerfeldt has remained Opeth's driving force throughout the years. Opeth has consistently incorporated progressive, folk, blues, classical and jazz influences into their usually lengthy compositions, as well as strong influences from black metal and death metal, especially in their early works. Many songs include acoustic guitar passages and strong dynamic shifts, as well as both death growls and clean vocals. Opeth rarely made live appearances supporting their first four albums; but since conducting their first world tour after the 2001 release of Blackwater Park, they have led several major world tours.\n\nOpeth has released ten studio albums, three live DVDs, three live albums (two that are in conjunction with DVDs), and two boxsets. The band released its debut album Orchid in 1995. Although their eighth studio album, Ghost Reveries, was quite popular in the United States, Opeth did not experience major American commercial success until the 2008 release of their ninth studio album, Watershed, which peaked at No. 23 on the Billboard 200, and topped the Finnish albums chart in its first week of release. Opeth has sold over 1.5 million albums and DVDs worldwide,including 300,000 collective Soundscans of their albums Blackwater Park, Damnation and Deliverance in the United States.\n\nContents\nPale Communion (2014Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\nMain article: Pale Communion\n\nIn August 2012, Ãƒâ€¦kerfeldt revealed that he has begun writing new material for what will be the eleventh Opeth album. Ãƒâ€¦kerfeldt stated that one song sounds like the band Goblin, which is also the working title for the song. An interview in June 2013 revealed that Ãƒâ€¦kerfeldt already has three songs composed and ready.[68] Ãƒâ€¦kerfeldt stated about the album, &quot;We've been looking at [tracking the next album at] Rockfield Studios in Wales where Queen recorded 'Bohemian Rhapsody', but we haven't made a decision yet, but it will be an expensive album. There's a lot going on, lots of string arrangements that we haven't had in the past.&quot; When asked if it will it be heavier or softer than Heritage, Ãƒâ€¦kerfeldt said, &quot;Maybe a little bit heavier, not death metal heavy, but hard rock/heavy metal heavy. There's also lots of progressive elements and acoustic guitars, but also more sinister-sounding riffs.&quot; Ãƒâ€¦kerfeldt will also produce the new album. The album will include string instrumentation, something that Ãƒâ€¦kerfeldt became interested in doing when working on the album Storm Corrosion. On March 20, 2014, Opeth announced that the new album is complete.\n\nOn April 7, 2014, Roadrunner Records announced that the title for Opeth's eleventh album is Pale Communion. Pale Communion is set to be released on August 26, 2014. The first single, &quot;Cusp of Eternity&quot;, was released on June 3, 2014.\nMusical style and influence","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6cb139e79be4548572aa2eb8852646a4be4f253","amp;dn":"Opeth+-+Pale+Communion+256k++mp3+++++ak2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6cb139e79be4548572aa2eb8852646a4be4f253","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,203,19,158,121,190,69,72,87,42,162,235,136,82,100,106,75,228,242,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
