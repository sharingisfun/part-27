Following her collaboration in 2013 with David Byrne, New York singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Annie Clark aka St Vincent returns to perform on the show, she released her fifth and self-titled album in early 2014. Former Roxy Music member and producer Brian Eno and front man of long-running dance outfit Underworld Karl Hyde have recorded an album entitled Someday World, which is an organic blend of melody and dance grooves. Also on the show are Ibibio Sound Machine, a British-based band who veer between the West African highlife sound mixed with modern post-punk and electro. Completing the line up are New York singer-songwriter Natalie Merchant, who has recorded her first new collection of original material for thirteen years, and George Ezra, who cites Bob Dylan and Woody Guthrie influences and is making his debut.\n\nTechnical Spec\nFilesize__: 1.59 GB\nRun-Time__: 30 min\nContainer_: TS\nVideo_____: h264 CABAC High L4.0 1920x1080i 25fps ~6769Kbps\nAudio#1___: AC3 CBR 2ch 48KHz 192Kbps\nAudio#2___: MP2 CBR 2ch 48KHz 256Kbps\nSubtitle#1: Text\nSubtitle#2: DVB Subtitle\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9d5f1433cf2ed2c326f30c4bb0766fd4364bb9a","amp;dn":"BBC.Later.Live.with.Jools.Holland.S44E05.1080i.h264-NX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9d5f1433cf2ed2c326f30c4bb0766fd4364bb9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,213,241,67,60,242,237,44,50,111,48,196,187,7,102,253,67,100,187,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
