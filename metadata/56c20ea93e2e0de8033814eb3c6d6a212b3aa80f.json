Happily, this is not the case with Paixoes Diagonais, which isn't fado lite, but simply fado with a few twists. \nStarting with the strictly traditional title track, the album slowly adds non-traditional elements like subtle string sections, unobtrusive keyboards and electric bass. Thankfully, they avoid the chattering sequencers and electronic beats that have ruined so many so-called world albums since the '80s. Even the least traditional track here, the almost Kate Bush-like &quot;Nascimento de Venus&quot; is rooted in traditional Portuguese fado, and Misia's spellbinding voice remains front and center throughout the album. \nWhile perhaps not for hard-line purists, this album is a terrific introduction to both Misia and fado in general.
