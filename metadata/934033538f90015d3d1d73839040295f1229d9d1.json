It is an hour long.\n\nScottish actor John Michie (Taggart &amp; Coronation Street) investigates two of the worst crimes that have occurred in Glasgow's history. \n\nThe documentary reveals more about the mass murder of six members of the innocent Doyle family in an arson attack during the infamous Ice-Cream wars, as they were caught in the crossfire of a criminal turf war. \n\nThe show also looks at the killing of Arthur Thompson Jnr, the son of GlasgowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 'Godfather', which led to revenge attacks and contract killings and the subsequent trial of gangland figure, Paul Ferris. \n\nBoth crimes led to the biggest trials Scotland had ever seen and both became mired in controversy and scandal. \n\nJohn Michie talks to those involved and finds out the real motives behind the crimes, using news footage, dramatic reconstructions and interviews with police and crime experts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:934033538f90015d3d1d73839040295f1229d9d1","amp;dn":"Murder+Capital+with+John+Michie+%28mkv%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"934033538f90015d3d1d73839040295f1229d9d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,64,51,83,143,144,1,93,61,29,115,131,144,64,41,95,18,41,217,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
