Elawyn of Canthas is one such Warrior Ã¢â‚¬â€ proud, dedicated and self-assured.\n\nWhen she lends a hand to defend a castle under attack, she begins an adventure that will take her far from home and everything she knows so well.\n\nPrincess Jayden of Marchan is not your every-day Princess. She is more apt to take up arms than adhere to the rigid code of behavior expected of royalty. Rescued by Elawyn, she finds herself paired with this reluctant and cocky ally in a fight for her life.\n\nAs the two women flee their enemies, they are stalked by a malevolent and mysterious army that will stop at nothing to destroy the Princess. Elawyn and Jayden must discover the identity of these Grey Men and their elusive leader before all is lost.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7eec0570c1ee821cca32b962e92e2abd108ca8a4","amp;dn":"FF+Lesley+Davis+-+%28Adepts+of+Calluna%29+02+Constellations+of+the+H","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7eec0570c1ee821cca32b962e92e2abd108ca8a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,236,5,112,193,238,130,28,202,50,185,98,233,46,42,189,16,140,168,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
