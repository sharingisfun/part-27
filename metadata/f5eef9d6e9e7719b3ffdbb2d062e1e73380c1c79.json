This is the third time Sondheim has been the programme's\n      subject and he talks about how Hammerstein ignited his desire to\n      write by taking him to see the musical Carousel, and advised him\n      to work with Bernstein on West Side Story, Sondheim's first big\n      break. The film includes clips from current Broadway productions\n      of A Little Night Music and West Side Story, and footage from\n      the previous South Bank Shows.\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n        We are looking for:                           \n                                                                     \n      .EU Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED.                              \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      Can't get in contact with us?
