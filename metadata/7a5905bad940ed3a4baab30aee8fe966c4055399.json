The version on Diana Extended: The Remixes is a short remix available\npreviously on a 12&quot; single.\n\nThe album was only moderately successful on both sides of the Atlantic, reaching #58\non the UK charts and #68 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, while missing the Top\n200 entirely. &quot;Someday We'll Be Together&quot; was released as a single and peaked at #\n7 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play charts (April 1994).\n\nThe US version of the album was released on Motown, and European/Japanese\nversions on EMI.
