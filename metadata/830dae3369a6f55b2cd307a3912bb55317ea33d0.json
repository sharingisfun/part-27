These stories are disturbing (sometimes gross, sometimes grotesquely funny), written on topics as far-reaching as necrophilia, rape, murder and suicide (hell, I even wrote a goddamned H.P. Lovecraftish one!)\n\nIf you like these (and how could you not?), please feel free to buy, rate, comment or suggest them to others...I'll provide the Amazon link down in the comments once it's been released, hopefully before Halloween.\n\n\n \nI put a lot of time and care into polishing these stories to a high gloss, so here's hoping that they aren't all turds.\n\n\n \nFeel free to distribute outside of The Pirate Bay, as I'll need all the help I can get.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProud long-time user, first-time caller.\n\n\nNicholas Bowen (esq.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWARNING: STORIES CONTAIN EXPLICIT MATERIAL","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:830dae3369a6f55b2cd307a3912bb55317ea33d0","amp;dn":"Ugly+Stories+preview+%282013%29+Short+Horror+Fiction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"830dae3369a6f55b2cd307a3912bb55317ea33d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,13,174,51,105,166,245,91,44,211,7,163,145,43,181,83,23,234,51,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
