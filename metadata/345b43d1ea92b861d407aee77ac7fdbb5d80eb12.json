Karthik's friend introduces him to a cinematographer, Ganesh (Ganesh Janardhanan). With Ganesh's help Karthik becomes an assistant to director K. S. Ravikumar. Karthik's family, who are Hindus, rent Jessie's (Trisha Krishnan) family's house. Jessie's family is a conservative Malayali Catholic Christian family from Alappuzha, Kerala, who live on the floor upstairs. When Karthik meets Jessie for the first time, he falls in love with her. Karthik expresses his love one day to Jessie, who is afraid of speaking to other men around her strict father's sight, and ends up angering Jessie. The two meet several times and Jessie begins to admit that she also liked Karthik, but wants to refrain from any problems because she knows her father won't accept a Hindu to marry his daughter. But due to various misunderstandings between Jessie's brother and Karthik, Her parents come to know about their affair and arrange a marriage for her. But at the wedding, she refuses to marry the groom, displeasing everyone in her family. Karthik and Jessie continue to love each other without the knowledge of their parents. At this point of time, Karthik goes to Goa on a 40-day shoot, where he gets rather busy. Meanwhile, the topic of Jessie's marriage comes up again at her home when the guy whom she refuses to marry earlier pays them a visit. Panicking, Jessie calls Karthik and tells him that she wants to elope with him. Karthik, since he is traveling through less than comfortable places, tells Jessie to stay in Chennai for now, and that soon he would be back and they can discuss. Jessie doesn't take his calls- so Karthik goes back one night to Chennai to check on Jessie. Jessie has decided to break up, as the relationship is not peaceful due to her parents disapproval. She doesn't want Karthik to wait for her too long, as he has his dreams to fulfill. Karthik later comes to know that she is married and settled abroad.\nTwo years later, Karthik meets Nandhini (Samantha Ruth Prabhu), who falls in love with him, but is rejected by Karthik who cites his previous affair with Jessie over whom he has still not got over. He then comes up with a script for his first film, which happens to be his very own love story. He calls upon Naga Chaitanya as the films protagonist, Nandhini as the female lead and Ganesh as the film's cinematographer, and the film was eventually titled Jessie. During shooting for the film in New York, United States, he randomly sees Jessie again and she comes and speaks with him. She says that she is not married and is still in love with him, and he too says she is still in his heart. Karthi proposes yet again and they get married the same day. But this is actually revealed to be a scene in Karthik's movie- which Karthik &amp; Jessie in real life are watching together in the theatre. In real life Jessie and Karthik have parted ways and are leading different lives and destinies.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1609168/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1609168/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nInfo\n\nFormat                           : Matroska\nFile size                        : 2.18 GiB\nWidth                            : 1280 pixels\nHeight                           : 540 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 2.35:1\nBit rate                         : 1986 Kbps\n\nAudio Format                      : AC-3\nBit rate                         : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 6 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tamilcreation.com/forum/showthread.php?77289-Vinnaithandi-Varuvaya-720p-1-2-DVD-Upscaled-Esubs-(Untouched-AC3)-Reaper&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tamilcreation.com/forum/showthread.php?77289-Vinnaithandi-Varuvaya-720p-1-2-DVD-Upscaled-Esubs-(Untouched-AC3)-Reaper&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:345b43d1ea92b861d407aee77ac7fdbb5d80eb12","amp;dn":"Vinnaithandi+Varuvaya+720p+1%2F2+DVD+Upscaled+Esubs+%28Untouched+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"345b43d1ea92b861d407aee77ac7fdbb5d80eb12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,91,67,209,234,146,184,97,212,7,174,231,122,199,253,187,93,128,235,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
