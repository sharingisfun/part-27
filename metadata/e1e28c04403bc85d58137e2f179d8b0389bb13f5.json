I made a few changes to the formatting but otherwise didn't touch the text, then produced the epub and mobi files.\n\n\ndescription:\n\nIn his startling, witty, and inexhaustibly inventive first novel, the author of Vox and The Fermata uses a one-story escalator ride as the occasion for a dazzling reappraisal of everyday objects and rituals. From the humble milk carton to the act of tying oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shoes, The Mezzanine at once defamiliarizes the familiar world and endows it with loopy and euphoric poetry. Nicholson BakerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s accounts of the ordinary become extraordinary through his sharp storytelling and his unconventional, conversational style. At first glance, The Mezzanine appears to be a book about nothing. In reality, it is a brilliant celebration of things, simultaneously demonstrating the value of reflection and the importance of everyday human human experiences.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1e28c04403bc85d58137e2f179d8b0389bb13f5","amp;dn":"Nicholson+Baker+-+The+Mezzanine+%28epub%2C+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1e28c04403bc85d58137e2f179d8b0389bb13f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,226,140,4,64,59,200,93,88,19,126,47,23,157,139,3,137,187,19,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
