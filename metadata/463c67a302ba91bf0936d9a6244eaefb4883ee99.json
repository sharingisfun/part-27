Well, in these pages there are plenty of both, and all are wickedly delicious. Deviled eggs, a perennial favorite of potluck suppers and picnics, a party food that is nearly perfect in its simplicity and speed of preparation, are basking in a long-awaited renaissance.\nTechnically, deviled eggs should be revved up with a little something spicy, but these recipes show that they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to be hot to be fabulous. Flavors can range from light to elegant to gutsy to fiery. Fillings can be as smooth as silk or chock full and chunky.\nIf youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a purist, take a trip down memory lane with the best of the classics, infused with fresh herbs and mild mustards. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking for something different and fun, try out combos including blue cheese and bacon or pepperoni and parmesan. Or maybe you want to impress your friends with your international palate by including the flavors of Indian chutney and curry, Italian sun-dried tomatoes and pesto, or Greek feta and olives. And if you love to go for the burn, well, welcome to perdition, where eggs stuffed with salsas or chilies, wasabi or jerk seasoning await the brave.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:463c67a302ba91bf0936d9a6244eaefb4883ee99","amp;dn":"Deviled+Eggs+by+Debbie+Moose","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"463c67a302ba91bf0936d9a6244eaefb4883ee99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,60,103,163,2,186,145,191,9,54,217,166,36,78,174,251,72,131,238,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
