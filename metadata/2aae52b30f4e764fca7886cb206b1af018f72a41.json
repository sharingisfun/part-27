As a result, our country has generally worked to keep the military out of law enforcement. But according to investigative reporter Radley Balko, over the last several decades, AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cops have increasingly come to resemble ground troops. The consequences have been dire: the home is no longer a place of sanctuary, the Fourth Amendment has been gutted, and police today have been conditioned to see the citizens they serve as an otherÃ¢â‚¬â€an enemy.\n\nTodayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s armored-up policemen are a far cry from the constables of early America. The unrest of the 1960s brought about the invention of the SWAT unitÃ¢â‚¬â€which in turn led to the debut of military tactics in the ranks of police officers. NixonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s War on Drugs, ReaganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s War on Poverty, ClintonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s COPS program, the postÃ¢â‚¬â€œ9/11 security state under Bush and Obama: by degrees, each of these innovations expanded and empowered police forces, always at the expense of civil liberties. And these are just four among a slew of reckless programs.\n\nIn Rise of the Warrior Cop, Balko shows how politiciansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ill-considered policies and relentless declarations of war against vague enemies like crime, drugs, and terror have blurred the distinction between cop and soldier. His fascinating, frightening narrative shows how over a generation, a creeping battlefield mentality has isolated and alienated American police officers and put them on a collision course with the values of a free society.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KaCIfaaFb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KaCIfaaFb&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2aae52b30f4e764fca7886cb206b1af018f72a41","amp;dn":"Rise+of+the+Warrior+Cop_The+Militarization+of+America%27s+Police+F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2aae52b30f4e764fca7886cb206b1af018f72a41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,174,82,179,15,78,118,79,202,120,134,203,32,107,26,240,24,247,42,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
