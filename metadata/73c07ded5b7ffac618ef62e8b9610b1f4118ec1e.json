Philippe Escoubet\n\n\nPublisher:   Springer\nNumber Of Pages:   489\nPublication Date:   2010-01-01\nISBN-10 / ASIN:   9048134986\nISBN-13 / EAN:   9789048134984\n\n\nProduct Description: \nSince the year 2000 the ESA Cluster mission has been investigating the small-scale structures and processes of the Earth's plasma environment, such as those involved in the interaction between the solar wind and the magnetospheric plasma, in global magnetotail dynamics, in cross-tail currents, and in the formation and dynamics of the neutral line and of plasmoids.\n\nThis book contains presentations made at the 15th Cluster workshop held in March 2008. It also presents several articles about the Cluster Active Archive and its datasets, a few overview papers on the Cluster mission, and articles reporting on scientific findings on the solar wind, the magnetosheath, the magnetopause and the magnetotail.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73c07ded5b7ffac618ef62e8b9610b1f4118ec1e","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2010%5D+The+Cluster+Active+Archive+Studying+the+Earth%5C%27s+Sp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73c07ded5b7ffac618ef62e8b9610b1f4118ec1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,192,125,237,91,127,250,198,24,239,98,232,185,97,11,31,65,24,236,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
