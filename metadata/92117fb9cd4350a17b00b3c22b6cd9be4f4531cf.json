But when Valeria, a senator's daughter, is sent to the Wall for an arranged marriage to an aristocratic officer in 367 AD, her journey unleashes jealousy, passion and epic war. Valeria's new husband, Marcus, has supplanted the brutally efficient veteran soldier Galba as commander of the famed Petriana cavalry. Yet Galba insists on escorting the brideÃ¢â‚¬â€œtoÃ¢â‚¬â€œbe on her journey to the Wall. Is he submitting to duty? Or plotting revenge? And what is the mysterious past of the handsome barbarian chieftain Arden Caratacus, who springs from ambush and who seems to know so much of hated Rome?\n\nAs sharp as the edge of a spatha sword and as piercing as a Celtic arrow, Hadrian's Wall evokes a lost world of Roman ideals and barbaric romanticism.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92117fb9cd4350a17b00b3c22b6cd9be4f4531cf","amp;dn":"Hadrian%27s+Wall+-+William+Dietrich+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92117fb9cd4350a17b00b3c22b6cd9be4f4531cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,17,127,185,205,67,80,161,123,0,179,194,43,108,217,190,79,69,49,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
