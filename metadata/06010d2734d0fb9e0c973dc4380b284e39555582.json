The protagonist, Saki Watanabe, lives in an idyllic village barred from the outside world. Her world is ruled by the people who possess the &quot;gods' power&quot; of psychokinesis. After finally obtaining her own powers, Saki enters the Zenjin Academy to train along with five other children: Satoru Asahina, Maria Akizuki, Mamoru Itou, Shun Aonuma, and Reiko Amano.\n\nNot all is as it seems, however. In this utopian village, strange rumors about a monstrous cat that abducts children circulate, and students are said to disappear from the academy. The world and its history are much darker than they appear and humanity is on the verge of collapse.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06010d2734d0fb9e0c973dc4380b284e39555582","amp;dn":"Shinsekai+Yori+19+-+25+%5B720p%5D+%5BEng+Sub%5D+%5BThund3r3mp3ror%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06010d2734d0fb9e0c973dc4380b284e39555582","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,1,13,39,52,208,251,158,12,151,61,196,56,11,40,78,57,85,85,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
