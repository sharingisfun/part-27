One of the women, Florrie (Betty Field), is pregnant and accompanied by her husband, Charles (Eddie Albert), while the others are single and on their own. The mission has become crowded after a cholera epidemic forced several outsiders to flee a nearby British mission and seek shelter with the American group, while a Mongol warrior, Tunga Khan (Mike Mazurki), has assembled troops who are sacking the area. When a female doctor, Dr. D.L. Cartwright (Anne Bancroft), enters the picture, she attempts to bring humor and civility to the group, but her tough yet compassionate nature clashes with Agatha's by-the-book approach, and when Cartwright is willing to put her own safety at risk to gain the attentions of Tunga Khan and slow his onslaught, the group is strongly divided -- most of the women admire the doctor's bravery, but Agatha (who seems to have a non-professional interest in Cartwright herself) considers her foolish and reckless. Seven Women was originally planned to star Patricia Neal as Dr. Cartwright, but when she suffered a stroke during filming that put her acting career on hold for several years, Anne Bancroft was recast in the role. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : 7 women.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 840 MiB\n      Duration : 1h 22mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 417 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 22mn\n      Bit rate : 1 327 Kbps\n      Width : 656 pixels\n      Height : 288 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 2.25:1\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.281\n      Stream size : 787 MiB (94%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 22mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 76.7 Kbps\n      Minimum bit rate : 32.0 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 45.5 MiB (5%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 505 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.97b\n      Encoding settings : -m m -V 3 -q 3 -lowpass 18 --vbr-new -b 32\n\nIMDB: tt0060050\n\nEnglish audio; French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted originally at KG by pa6sur","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d926a72710bbeafc2286d8bd080c72a071afff07","amp;dn":"John+Ford+-+7+Women+%5B1966%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d926a72710bbeafc2286d8bd080c72a071afff07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,38,167,39,16,187,234,252,34,134,216,189,8,12,114,160,113,175,255,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
