The song was later covered by The Beatles during a 1963 session on the BBC, that is available on the album Live at the BBC;\n   &quot;One After 909&quot; (sometimes titled The One After 909 in early recordings) is a song by The Beatles, written by John Lennon, with input from Paul McCartney (credited to LennonÃ¢â‚¬â€œMcCartney), and originally released in 1970 on the album &quot;Let It Be&quot;. \n    The song was written as early as 1957, and is one of the first LennonÃ¢â‚¬â€œMcCartney compositions. The Beatles recorded a version of the song on 5 March 1963 during the same session that produced their third single, &quot;From Me to You,&quot; and its B-side &quot;Thank You Girl.&quot; They were unhappy with the result and that version was not released at the time. Various takes from the 5 March session, and an edit of them, were released in 1995 on the Anthology 1 compilation.\n    In his 1980 Playboy interview, Lennon explained, &quot;That was something I wrote when I was about seventeen. I lived at 9 Newcastle Road. I was born on the ninth of October, the ninth month . It's just a number that follows me around, but, numerologically, apparently I'm a number six or a three or something, but it's all part of nine.&quot; McCartney said, &quot;It's not a great song but it's a great favourite of mine because it has great memories for me of John and I trying to write a bluesy freight-train song. There were a lot of those songs at the time, like 'Midnight Special', 'Freight Train', 'Rock Island Line', so this was the 'One After 909'; she didn't get the 909, she got the one after it.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dbed9ac40248e13d45b861ef7aeb23b455a18b8","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+402","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1dbed9ac40248e13d45b861ef7aeb23b455a18b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,190,217,172,64,36,142,19,212,91,134,30,247,174,178,59,69,90,24,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
