At Scorpion HQ, everyone is excited when an authentic original Proton Arnold video game is delivered. Ralph's father Drew comes by to bring him to school. He speaks to Walter privately, thanking him for the pitching clinic he helped him put on for Ralph. It helped Drew's delivery and he has a tryout with an AA team in Portland. He wants Walter's opinion on what him leaving -- or having Paige and Ralph come with him -- would do to Ralph. Walter may not be big on emotions, but he looks like a man trying not to seethe. Cabe Gallo sees Walter's reaction and makes up an errand for them to run together. On the way, Cabe get's a text with an emergency code word and uses evasive driving maneuvers all the way to a low rent hotel. He knocks on a door and his ex-wife Rebecca opens it. He hasn't heard from her in 15 years, but she's in-house counsel for a lobbying firm and stumbled on something illegal and is now in trouble.\n\nÃ‚Â \n\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4155122/?ref_=ttep_ep9&quot;&gt;IMDB&lt;/a&gt;\nRatings: 8.8/10 from 26 users   \n\nÃ‚Â \n&lt;blockquote&gt;Encoding Information\nGeneral           : Scorpion.S01E09.720p.WEB-DL.ReEnc.QAAC.x264-xRed\nFormat            : MPEG-4 at 1 446 Kbps\nLength            : 420 MiB for 40mn 36s 608ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 1 272 Kbps\nAspect            : 1280 x 720 (1.778) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AAC at 167 Kbps\nInfos             : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10d18b1bb894ca555073f57f6c8c5ac9ca6e0a64","amp;dn":"Scorpion+S01E09+720p+WEB-DL+ReEnc+QAAC+x264-xRed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10d18b1bb894ca555073f57f6c8c5ac9ca6e0a64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,209,139,27,184,148,202,85,80,115,245,127,108,140,90,201,202,110,10,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
