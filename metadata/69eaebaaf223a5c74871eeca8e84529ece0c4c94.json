Some songs its Hendrix with Curtis Knight. Others I don't know. \nOn track 11 Jim Morrison is singing along; if that is what Hendrix is shouting into the microphone....\n\nTrack list: \n\n1.  Strange Things\n2. Welcome Home\n3. Day Tripper \t\n4. Simon Says\n5. Fool You Baby \t\t\t\n6. Don't Accuse Me \t\t\t\n7. Flashing \t\n8. Voice In The Wind \n9. Odd Ball \n10. Bring My Baby Back\n11. WhoaEeh\n12. Good Times\n13. Psycho\n14. Sweet Thang\n15. Hornet's Nest\n16. Happy Birthday\n\nRipped with Rubyripper 0.6.2 on Ubuntu 14.04. Rubyripper encountered some errors with tracks 6, 12, and 14. See ripping log file. At first glance/listen they\nseem fine, but just to be sure there's a folder added with those tracks ripped with CDex on Windows 7. \n\nEnjoy &amp; seed + share please!\n\njoh73","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69eaebaaf223a5c74871eeca8e84529ece0c4c94","amp;dn":"Jimi+Hendrix+%281988%29+16+greatest+classics+MP3+320Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69eaebaaf223a5c74871eeca8e84529ece0c4c94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,234,235,170,242,35,165,199,72,113,238,202,142,132,82,158,206,12,76,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
