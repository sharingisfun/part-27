He is startled to see that numerous data about him has been collected about him there. Superman flies up with the laboratory and places it at a lagrange point in space. Coming back to Metropolis, he finds an attempted bank heist and a new villain. They start fighting each other and it is later revealed that the villain is Metallo, a man with a heart of Kryptonite and with enough power to kill Superman.
