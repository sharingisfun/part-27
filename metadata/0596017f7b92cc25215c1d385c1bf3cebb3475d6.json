I have made the images with CloneCD so you can make CD-discs with Alcohol or CloneCD.\n\nNote 1: I attached a reg-file (*.reg) in the root-folder. You can use this file before the installation too fool MapSource that you allready have an old version of City Select installed. After the installation I advise you to delete this line from the registry to avoid conflicts:\n\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREGarminMapSourceFamiliesEuropean City Select Version 5]\n\nNote 2: MapSource will probably ask you to enter a code (25-character) to unlock the maps. I tried this code: HXU65-4JEC4-AH7MC-C2F2H-2ZF4N. It seemed to work but it did not unlock the map details.\n\nI believe there is a lot of different solutions to the mentioned problems but the main problem still exists: How to have the MapSource program to accept  transfering of maps to any Garmin GPS-receiver without a serial number? Does anybody have any suggestions?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0596017f7b92cc25215c1d385c1bf3cebb3475d6","amp;dn":"City+Select+7+update+for+Garmin+-+on+3+original+discs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0596017f7b92cc25215c1d385c1bf3cebb3475d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,150,1,127,123,146,204,37,33,92,29,56,92,27,243,206,187,52,117,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
