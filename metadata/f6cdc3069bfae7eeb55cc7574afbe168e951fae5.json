When you're out on the street in the middle of the night wearing your little French Maid outfit, with the short skirt and the off-the-shoulder top, Jack Daniels isn't just your friend, it's your coat.  And the 9mm in your tray isn't just your protection... it's the compass that points you the way home.\n\nWritten by Kirsten Baldock and illustrated by Fabio Moon.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6cdc3069bfae7eeb55cc7574afbe168e951fae5","amp;dn":"Smoke+and+Guns+%28AiT%2FPlanet+Lar%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6cdc3069bfae7eeb55cc7574afbe168e951fae5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,205,195,6,155,250,231,238,181,92,199,87,74,251,225,104,233,81,250,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
