This release 2002 on Fantasy/Original Jazz Classics.\nMONO.\n\nThe review below is for Vol 1. \nVol 2 was recorded at the same concert with the same lineup of course.\n\nReview by Scott Yanow:\nThis CD brings back a near-classic (one of many from this period) by the Dave Brubeck Quartet. Drummer Joe Dodge had just joined the group and he joins with bassist Ron Crotty in laying down a solid and subtle foundation. However the real action takes place up front with pianist Dave Brubeck and altoist Paul Desmond. Their individual solos are full of creative ideas on six standards (most memorable are &quot;All The Things You Are,&quot; &quot;Laura&quot; and &quot;I'll Never Smile Again&quot;) and their interaction and tradeoffs are timeless. Recommended.\n\nVol 1:\n01. All The Things You Are   \n02. Laura   \n03. Lullaby In Rhythm   \n04. I'll Never Smile Again   \n05. I Remember You   \n06. For All We Know  \n\nVol 2:\n01. Crazy Rhythm    \n02. Let's Fall In Love    \n03. Stardust   \n04. How High The Moon    \n05. The Way You Look Tonight  \n06. Love Walked In   \n07. Give A Little Whistle    \n08. I Found A New Baby \n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22de2b7a5232f1f22814bc5202dee96ad9f3aaf7","amp;dn":"Dave+Brubeck+Quartet+-+Jazz+At+The+College+Of+The+Pacific+%28Vols+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22de2b7a5232f1f22814bc5202dee96ad9f3aaf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,222,43,122,82,50,241,242,40,20,188,82,2,222,233,106,217,243,170,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
