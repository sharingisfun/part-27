The first major update was released in 2004 \nand distributed by Tier 1 OEMs who had previously sold Windows XP Media Center Edition PC, and then updated again in 2005, which was the first edition available for System Builders. Many of the features of Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 (including screen dancers, auto playlist DJ, and high end visual screen savers) were taken from the Windows XP Plus! packages. These were originally shipped as add ons to Windows XP to enhance the users experience of their Windows XP machine.\n\n\nThe most notable feature unique to this edition is the Windows Media Center, which provides a large-font (&quot;10-foot&quot;), remotely accessible interface for television viewing on the computer as well as recording \n\nand playback, a TV guide, DVD playback, video playback, photo viewing, and music playback. Unlike \n\ncompeting commercial digital video recorder products, Microsoft does not charge a monthly subscription \n\nfee for its Media Center TV guide service.\n\n\nMedia Center has higher hardware requirements than other editions of Windows XP. MCE 2005 requires at \n\nleast a 1.6 GHz processor, DirectX 9.0 hardware-accelerated GPU (ATI Radeon 9 series or nVidia GeForce \n\nFX Series or higher), and 256 MB of system RAM. Some functionality, such as Media Center Extender \n\nsupport, use of multiple tuners, or HDTV playback/recording carries higher system requirements.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1316eca8e7af576cbe2d9aa760faabd42289004","amp;dn":"Windows+XP+Media+Center+Edition+2005+SP2+EN+%2F%2F%2FINFECTED+PIRATER%2F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1316eca8e7af576cbe2d9aa760faabd42289004","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,49,110,202,142,122,245,118,203,226,217,170,118,15,170,189,66,40,144,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
