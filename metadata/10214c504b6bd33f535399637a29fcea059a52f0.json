In fact, for some reason, if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re behind transparent proxy set up by ISP without your knowledge, or using Torrent Harvester in Windows Vista (both cases is supported and should work, but sometimes update may fail due to unknown reason), an error may occur with the following message.\n\n    The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occured on a receive.\n\nThe problem is due to a bug in Microsoft .NET framework that closes the data transfer connection prior to it being finished. The bug is not yet fixed or given a workaround in Torrent Harvester version 0.7b. Together with proxy support, until itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fixed in the next version, users will be unable to retrieve the latest engines with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCheck for UpdatesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ within Torrent Harvester program.\n\nThe solution, or workaround to fix the problem is by manually update the engines in Torrent Harvester. To allow users to do so, a downloadable package refreshed on 19th July 2007 that contains all latest 175 engines available for Torrent Harvestor, including new or updated search engines, has been released for download. Then use the following step-by-step guide to update the engines manually.\n\n   1. Torrent Harvester on install will come with 88 engines. This can be verified on the black startup splash screen.\n\n      Torrent Harvester Engines\n   2. Close and exit from any instance of Torrent Harvester program opened.\n   3. Download Torrent Harvester 175 Engines Update Package (TorrentHarvesterEnginesPack.zip).\n   4. Use Windows Explorer or Run command to open and browse to C:Program FilesTorrent Harvester folder (or your own installation path if changed).\n   5. Delete and remove Engines and Temp folders.\n   6. Unpack and extract the TorrentHarvesterEnginesPack.zip archive. It should contains hundreds of files inside Engines and Temp folders.\n   7. Move or copy these 2 folders to inside the C:Program FilesTorrent Harvester folder, replacing the original folders (which should have been deleted, if not the should overwrite all existing files in destination folders).\n   8. Close the Windows Explorer.\n   9. Run Torrent Harvester.
