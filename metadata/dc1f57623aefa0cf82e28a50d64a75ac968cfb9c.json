The pint-sized American guitarist knocked me sideways last year with her stupendously good Dreaming Of Revenge, and has happily wasted little time in returning with new material ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ sadly itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s only five tracks in length but those tracks are still way out of the ordinary in comparison to most peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music.\n\n\n\nThough ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDreaming Of RevengeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ did feature some vocals, this time round she has gone for the strictly instrumental approach. The title track kicks off proceedings with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ gasp ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ distortion all over the shop. Not exactly Kaki-King-goes-metal, but certainly somewhere along the lines of My Bloody Valentine learn to play their instruments and jam with Josh Homme. This is followed by song-title-of-the-year contender ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGouge Both Your Eyes Out (But Eat Only One)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, another very rocking tune by her standards which is simultaneously grooving and very danceable.\n\n\n\nThis rockier vein continues until the final track, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA Long Time To Go Before We Are Truly DanlikeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, a more abstract electronic hypnotic composition which IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m guessing is named after her collaborator Dan Brantigan (itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a Kaki thing, mmmkay?) and rounds things off suitably oddly. Another excellent stride in the musical development of a truly special artist ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ get checking her out if you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know what all the fuss is about!\n\n\n\n\nBy: Eddie Thomas\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc1f57623aefa0cf82e28a50d64a75ac968cfb9c","amp;dn":"Kaki+King","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc1f57623aefa0cf82e28a50d64a75ac968cfb9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,31,87,98,58,239,160,207,130,226,138,80,214,74,117,172,150,140,251,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
