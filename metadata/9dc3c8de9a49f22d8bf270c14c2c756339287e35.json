What was up with that video for &quot;Walk Like an Egyptian,&quot; anyway? Greatest Hits puts it all in perspective, tracing the curve from the post-Beatles group sneer of &quot;Hero Takes a Fall&quot; to the deadly earnest Susanna Hoffs showcase of &quot;Eternal Flame.&quot; Shortly after that ballad hit No. 1, the group split. Now unfairly remembered as little more than space fillers on turn-of-the-decade airwaves, the Bangles here make a good case for their spirit, their own songwriting gifts, and, of course, those voices. --Rickey Wright\n\nEncoded using dbPowerAmp Music Converter with AccurateRip at 128kbps ABR.
