Star fleet is very optimistic, but, Kirk fears -\r\neven in a testing situation - removing humans from the equation is a very\r\ndangerous position to be left in. A position of life or death.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeason II\r\n\r\nEpisode 24:\r\n\r\nTitle: The Ultimate Computer\r\nDirector: John Meredyth Lucas\r\nWriters: D.C. Fontana, Laurence N.

Once there, most of the crew is\r\nremoved - held in a security area, leaving only a minimal skeleton crew on-board.\r\nCommodore Bob Wesley arrives, and informs Kirk he's to be the 'fox in the hunt'\r\nof simulated war games to be played. To put the so far only-rumoured-to-exist\r\nM-5 Multitronic unit - through its paces. The M-5 computer is the latest invention\r\nof the brilliant Dr. Richard Daystrom, creator of the Duotronic computer systems,\r\nwhich run the Enterprise. Daystrom is confidant his unit can not only take control\r\nof the starship, but do a better job than humans can. At first, the Enterprise \r\nunder M-5's control easily defeats two other starships, but, begins to act \r\nindependently of its human masters, Daystrom has no interest in disconnecting the \r\nM-5 and treats it more like an errant child than a machine. For Kirk and the few \r\ncrew members still aboard, it becomes a matter of life and death when Starfleet \r\nCommand orders the Enterprise destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral:\r\n\r\nComplete name : 224 - The Ultimate Computer.mkv\r\nFormat : Matroska\r\nFormat version : Version 2\r\nFile size : 462 MB\r\nDuration : 50min 30sec\r\nOverall bit rate : 1278 Kbps\r\nEncoded date : UTC 2016-07-04T17:29:18Z\r\nWriting application : HandBrake 0.10.5\r\nWriting library : Lavf55.12.0\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo:\r\n\r\nID : 1\r\nFormat : AVC\r\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\r\nFormat profile :   \r\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\r\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 7 frames\r\nCodec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\r\nDuration : 50min 30sec\r\nBit rate : 1156 Kbps\r\nWidth : 1200 pixels\r\nHeight : 900 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 4:3\r\nFrame rate mode : Constant\r\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\r\n\r\n\r\nAudio:\r\n\r\nID : 2\r\nFormat : AC-3\r\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\r\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\r\nFormat settings, Endianness : Big\r\nCodec ID : A_AC3\r\nDuration : 50min 30sec\r\nBit rate mode : Constant\r\nBit rate : 96.0 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\r\nBit depth : 16 bits\r\nCompression mode : Lossy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6ee01e994ba3f7eaf38fdccec19a556f10c3943","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+S02E24+%281968%29+-+BDRip+x264+-+%5B%3DFaith%3D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6ee01e994ba3f7eaf38fdccec19a556f10c3943","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,238,1,233,148,186,63,126,175,56,253,204,236,25,165,86,241,12,57,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
