It redefined popular music and fashion, threatened the establishment, and legitimized an independent, do-it-yourself attitude. \n\nWith a star-studded cast of historic and modern figures in popular culture, this feature length film, PUNK:attitude takes a highly original look at this movement. Combining recent interviews with rare and famous archival performances, a chronological narrative emerges, allowing this incredible story to tell itself.\n\nDirected by Don Letts, who also brought us the Grammy Award-winning, The Clash: Westway to the World\n\n\\&quot;In the true spirit of anti-establishment Don Letts\\' PUNK: Attitude is one of the most informative documentaries on the punk ethos\\&quot;\n\n~ TIME OUT\n\nOfficial Selection\n\nTribeca International Film Festival 2005, Seattle Film Festival 2005, Melbourne International Film Festival 2005, Raindance International Film Festival 2005, Stockholm Film Festival 2005, Helsinki International Film Festival, Athens Film Festival 2005\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446765/\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:576af0b884d50e4efda9285513b133de7c0e7dc8","amp;dn":"PUNK+-+ATTITUDE+%28Documentary+2005%2C+MP4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"576af0b884d50e4efda9285513b133de7c0e7dc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,106,240,184,132,213,14,78,253,169,40,85,19,177,51,222,124,14,125,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
