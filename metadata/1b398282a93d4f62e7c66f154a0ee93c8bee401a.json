In less than a year after its formation, Kalmah was signed by Spinefarm Records. The word &quot;kalmah&quot; is Karelian and could be translated as &quot;to the grave&quot; or &quot;to the death.&quot;\nContents\n\nIn 1991, Pekka Kokko and Petri Sankala founded the metal band Ancestor. After Ancestor had recorded two demos, Antti Kokko joined the band as lead guitarist. In 1998, after five demos, Ancestor disbanded. Later in the same year, Kalmah formed. The new band consisted of Pekka Kokko performing vocals and guitar, Antti Kokko on lead guitar, Pasi Hiltula on keyboards, Altti VetelÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤inen on bass, and Petri Sankala on drums.\n\nKalmah began to write songs for a promotional CD entitled Svieri Obraza. With this demo, they acquired a recording contract with Spinefarm Records and headed to Tico-Tico Studios to record their debut album, Swamplord.\n\nBy November 2001, they returned to Tico-Tico Studios to record their second studio album, They Will Return. By this time, VetelÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤inen and Sankala were replaced by Timo Lehtinen on bass and Janne Kusmin on drums, respectively. In 2002, Kalmah played shows in Finland and at Wacken Open Air. In February 2003, they recorded their third studio album, Swampsong. In 2004, keyboardist Pasi Hiltula left and was replaced by Marco Sneck. The band released The Black Waltz in 2006 and For the Revolution in 2008. Kalmah toured in Canada and Finland to promote the latter album.\n\nStudio albums\n\n    * Swamplord (2000)\n    * They Will Return (2002)\n    * Swampsong (2003)\n    * The Black Waltz (2006)\n    * For the Revolution (2008)\n    * 12 Gauge (2010)\n\n\t\n\nDemos and EPs\n\n    As Ancestor\n\n        * Ethereal Devotion (1992)\n        * **Material World God** (1993)\n        * **With No Strings Attached** (1996)\n        * **Tomorrow** (1997)\n        * **Under the Burbot's Nest** (1998)\n\n    As Kalmah\n\n        * Svieri Obraza (1999) ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ promo\n        * Demo 2004 (2004) ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ unreleased\n\nReleases in asterisks are demos that I do not currently have, and need to fully complete my Kalmah discography.
