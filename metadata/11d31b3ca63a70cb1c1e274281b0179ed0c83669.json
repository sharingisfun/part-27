Jonny Kearney is a young songwriter from Northumberland, while Lucy Farrell is a singer from Kent. They met while studying in Newcastle, and were invited to open for the Unthanks on their extensive recent tour. If that wasn't enough, Rachel Unthank praised Kearney's &quot;heartbreaking&quot; songwriting, and she and her husband Adrian McNally even sing backing vocals on this debut mini album, which was recorded at their Northumberland home. It's easy to understand the appeal, for many of the songs are as delicate, thoughtful and sad-edged as those of the Unthanks. Even the traditional Hares on the Mountain now sounds thoughtful and intimate, while Kearney's gently personal compositions such as Song for a Sweetheart or the gently bleak Letters to Lenore match the duo's effortless harmonies with their equally delicate guitar, piano and violin work\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hotimg.com/direct/CAWuxEb.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hotimg.com/direct/CAWuxEb.gif&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11d31b3ca63a70cb1c1e274281b0179ed0c83669","amp;dn":"Jonny+Kearney+%26amp%3B+Lucy+Farrell...The+North+Farm+Sessions%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11d31b3ca63a70cb1c1e274281b0179ed0c83669","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,211,27,60,166,58,112,203,28,30,39,66,129,176,23,158,208,200,54,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
