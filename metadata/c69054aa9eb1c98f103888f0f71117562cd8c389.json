It offers an accessible and authoritative introduction to a range of historical, disciplinary, methodological, and cultural perspectives and addresses many of the issues facing a growing, varied, and increasingly international field of research. The collection also illustrates some of the challenges of defining and delimiting a relatively recent and eclectic field of studies, including debates on the very definition of &quot;business discourse.&quot; Part One includes chapters on the origins, advances, and features of business discourse in Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. Part Two covers methodological approaches such as mediated communication, corpus linguistics, organizational discourse, multimodality, race and management communication, and rhetorical analysis. Part Three looks at such disciplinary perspectives as sociology, pragmatics, gender studies, intercultural communication, linguistic anthropology, and business communication. Part Four considers cultural perspectives across a range of geographical areas including Spain, Brazil, Japan, Korea, China, and Vietnam. The concluding section reflects on future developments in Europe, North America, and Asia.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c69054aa9eb1c98f103888f0f71117562cd8c389","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2009%5D+The+Handbook+of+Business+Discourse","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c69054aa9eb1c98f103888f0f71117562cd8c389","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,144,84,170,158,177,201,143,16,56,136,240,247,17,23,86,44,216,195,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
