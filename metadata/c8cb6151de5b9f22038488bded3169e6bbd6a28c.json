And, how every single one of us is reacting to the biggest change in environment this planet has ever seen.\n\nTwo billion years ago life first arrived on this planet; a planet, which was filled with a natural frequency. As life slowly evolved, it did so surrounded by this frequency. and Inevitably, it began tuning in.\n\nBy the time mankind arrived on earth an incredible relationship had been struck; a relationship that science is just beginning to comprehend.\n\nResearch is showing that being exposed to this frequency is absolutely integral to us. It controls our mental and physical health, it synchronizes our circadian rhythms, and it aids our immune system and improves our sense of wellbeing.\n\nNot only are we surrounded by natural frequencies, our bodies are filled with them too. Our cells communicate using electro magnetic frequencies. Our brain emits a constant stream of frequencies and our DNA delivers instructions, using frequency waves. Without them we couldn't exist for more than a second.\n\nThis delicate balance has taken billions of years to perfect. But over the last 25 years the harmony has been disturbed. and disturbed dramatically.\n\nMankind has submerged itself in an ocean of artificial frequencies. They are all around us, filling the air and drowning out the earth's natural resonance.\n\nTo the naked eye the planet appears to be the same. But at a cellular level it is the biggest change that life on earth has endured; the affects of which we are just starting to see and feel.\n\n\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ PLEASE SIGN\n I have started a petition to have telecoms companies put warnings on the packaging.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ipetitions.com/petition/clear-health-warnings-on-cell-phone-packag...&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ipetitions.com/petition/clear-health-warnings-on-cell-phone-packag...&lt;/a&gt;\n\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ Enjoy the DVD \nMany people who are too electro sensative to watch the film online have contacted me so I have made a DVD available. can you please put a link to this also\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flatfrogfilms.com/resonance-documentary/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flatfrogfilms.com/resonance-documentary/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTHANK YOU\nTHANK YOU\nTHANK YOU","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8cb6151de5b9f22038488bded3169e6bbd6a28c","amp;dn":"Resonance+-+Beings+of+Frequency+%28WiFi%2FMicrowave%2FMobile+Phone+Doc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8cb6151de5b9f22038488bded3169e6bbd6a28c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,203,97,81,222,91,159,34,3,132,136,189,237,49,105,230,187,214,162,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
