This one was highly acclaimed by the\npress and fans. Now they present us their new\nalbum Motherland . Let s see if this is a\nworthy follow-up to the previous record\n\nA lot has happend over the time: beside some\nline-up changes Pretty Maids changed their sound\nfrom traditional Melodic Hard Rock into Melodic\nMetal on Pandemonium . This makeover was a step\nin the right direction, because the band sounded\nmore fresh and powerfull than ever and you found\na bunch of hits on this record. Just think of\nLittle Drops Of Heaven , Old Enough To Know\nIt Comes At Night and so on. With such an\namazing album in mind, it s always hard to\nproduce a successor with the same value\n\nSoundwise Motherland continues where\nPandemonium left off. But this is no surprise\nbecause the new record was produced by Jakob\nHansen again. So you can expect a very good\nproduction with proper pressure. Maybe\neverything sounds a bit darker this time\n\nThe opening track Mother Of All Lies is\nrepresentative for the whole album, that s why\nit s a good decision to be the first single. The\nsong has a very modern sound, a pounding rhythm\nsection and lots of synthie-effects in it\nSpeaking about this keyboard-parts I ve to say\nthat I like keys with 80's mood, but here the\nsynthie-parts sound too modern and they are too\npushy. You will find them on nearly every single\ntrack on Motherland and they are very\ndominant. For sure, this is a matter of taste\nI don t like them. I would have liked more\nriffing, than those keys, but ok they seem to\nbe an integral part of the band s new sound. To\nFool A Nation has a remarkable guitar part in\nit and is a good song not stunning, but still\na good song\n\nIn general I must say that this album is a\ngrower. You need to listen to it a several times\nto get into most of the songs. Consistently\ncatchy tunes are hard to find after the first\nlisten. This distinguishes Motherland from its\npredecessor, but you won t get tired of the\nsongs too fast\n\nConfession is some kind of intro of the next\nsong The Iceman . This tune has a really\nmysterious mood and great atmosphere. In fact\nthe whole album has lots of atmosphere. Next\nsong Sad To See You Suffer is the second\nsingle and a typical radio-friendly ballad. It s\na good song, but sadly not the over-the-top-hit\nI hoped for. Hooligan is a great straight\nahead rocker with cool gang-shouts and heavy\nriffs. Infinity brings some kind of epicness\nwith it. I can t help, but when I listen to this\nI always imagine a doomsday scenario. It s the\nsame with Wasted , but Infinity has a better\nchorus. Why So Serious is definitely one of\nthe highlights of this CD. This one is catchy\nbut also very heavy and the chorus is superb. I\nalways think of Heath Ledgers Joker from The\nDark Knight when I hear the line Why so\nserious? . Maybe it was inspired by this movie?\nWho knows?\n\nPretty Maids rock on with the title track\nMotherland . This song seems to be a real power\nmetal tune with its fast rhythm and pounding\ndrums. Cool song. I See Ghosts leaves me a bit\ndisappointing, because it can t keep up with the\ntwo previous songs. With Bullet For You the\nmoment finally arrived: this is the over-the\ntop-hit I ve been waiting for!\n\nThis one is a gem an amazing half-ballad with\na stunning chorus, a terrific guitar solo and\nnot so much keys in it. This all is crowned by\nthe unique voice of Ronnie Atkins. This man is\nfantastic. I admire his ability to change his\nstyle of singing from moment to moment. His\nvocal range is huge from emotional and clear\nto aggressive and rough.But also the other\nmusicians deliver high quality service here\nVery good job\n\nThe bottom line Pretty Maids present us a strong\nalbum with their unique music style, some\namazing songs (after a few runs) and the\nvariable voice of Ronnie Atkins, so this is a\nmust-buy for fans of this band and fans of\nMelodic Metal in general. Nevertheless\nMotherland couldn t fascinate me like\nPandemonium three years ago. This is due to\nthe permanent use of very modern keyboard-sounds\nand the fact that the new song material is not\nso accessible like it could be. All in all it s\na worthy follow-up to Pandemonium .
