BTW though I make no promises about the odds and ends of DC related stuff in the bottom of the Phantom's scanned list, so far I've skipped nothing. \n\nSpeaking of logical grouping (which I do later on), remember this isn't. It's reverse alphabetical by the Phantom's list (would that be omegapsical?). So things I would put in a complete Wonder Woman torrent may not be here if they don't start with &quot;Wonder&quot; as listed by the Phantom Stranger. \n\nToday's offering:\nWonder Woman-The Ultimate Guide to the Amazon Princess (Scott Beatty).cbr\nWonder Woman-The Once and Future Story.cbr\nWonder Woman-The Hiketeia-w:Batman (HC)(2002).cbr\nWonder Woman-The Complete History, Les Daniels (2004).cbr\nWonder Woman-The Blue Amazon-Superman-Elseworlds (2003).cbr\nWonder Woman-Spirit of Truth (2001).cbr\nWonder Woman-Our Worlds At War (2001).cbr\nWonder Woman-Donna Troy-Girlfrenzy.cbr\nWonder Woman-Amazonia-Elseworlds (1997).cbr\nWonder Woman v3 Annual 001 (2007).cbr\nWonder Woman v3 01-26 (2006-Ongoing)\nWonder Woman v2 Zero (10-1994).cbr\nWonder Woman v2 Annuals 01-08 (1988-1999)\nWonder Woman v2 1,000,000 (1998).cbr\nWonder Woman v2 001-226 (1987-2006)\nWonder Woman v1 001-329 (1942-1985)\nWonder Woman Spectacular-DC Special Series v2 009 (1978).cbr\nWonder Woman Special 001-Death Stroke (1992).cbr\nWonder Woman Secret Files &amp; Origins (2002).cbr\nWonder Woman Secret Files &amp; Origins (1999).cbr\nWonder Woman Secret Files &amp; Origins (1998).cbr\nWonder Woman Plus+ Jesse Quick (1997).cbr\nWonder Woman Omitted (see below)\nWonder Woman Odds and Ends (see below)\nWonder Woman Newspaper Strips (1944-45).cbr\nWonder Woman Gallery (1996).cbr\nWonder Woman Cover Variants (see below)\nWonder Woman Archives v4 (2003).cbr - most people would omit this, but not me!\nWonder Woman Archives v2(i).cbr\nWonder Woman Archives v1.cbr\nWonder Woman 80-Page Giant 001 (2002).cbr\n\nWonder Woman Omitted\nOmitted titles are reprints. The stories appear in the original comics. The covers are included here. As an insane more-than-completist I would include them but they tend not to be scanned or shared, being duplicate material. I think some of them have value as &quot;Best of&quot; collections, others are just  collected issues of a story line. If I have them I share, I don't make a lot of effort to find them even if they exist.\n\nWonder Woman-Who is Wonder Woman HC (Omitted).jpg\nWonder Woman-The Greatest Stories Ever Told TPB (Omitted).jpg\nWonder Woman-The Contest TPB (Omitted).jpg\nWonder Woman-The Challenge of Artemis TPB (Omitted).jpg\nWonder Woman-Second Genesis TPB (Omitted).jpg\nWonder Woman-Paradise Lost TPB (Omitted).jpg\nWonder Woman-Paradise Found TPB (Omitted).jpg\nWonder Woman-Mission's End TPB (Omitted).jpg\nWonder Woman-Love and Murder HC (Omitted).jpg\nWonder Woman-Lifelines TPB (Omitted).jpg\nWonder Woman-Land of the Dead TPB (Omitted).jpg\nWonder Woman-Hiketeia TPB (Omitted).jpg\nWonder Woman-Gods of Gotham TPB (Omitted).jpg\nWonder Woman-Gods and Mortals TPB (Omitted).jpg\nWonder Woman-Eyes of the Gorgon TPB (Omitted).jpg\nWonder Woman-Down to Earth TPB (Omitted).jpg\nWonder Woman-Destiny Calling TPB (Omitted).jpg\nWonder Woman-Challenge of the Gods TPB (Omitted).jpg\nWonder Woman-Bitter Rivals TPB (Omitted).jpg\nWonder Woman-Beauty and the Beasts TPB (Omitted).jpg\nWonder Woman-Amazons Attack TPB (Omitted).jpg\nWonder Woman Archives v5 HC (Omitted).jpg\nWonder Woman Archives v3 HC (Omitted).jpg\nWonder Woman Archives v2 HC (Omitted).jpg\nDiana Prince-Wonder Woman v1 TPB (Omitted).jpg\n\nWonder Woman Odds and Ends\n\nSome of the stuff here actually may belong higher in the list, but verifying their status is too much like work so I put them in here.
