Rowland takes some licence with known figures, creating fictionalised versions of Tokugawa Tsunayoshi and Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu. Objective historical details, however, are credibly accurate.\n\nSeries\nSano Ichiro\n1. Shinju (1994)\n2. Bundori (1996)\n3. The Way of the Traitor (1997)\n4. The Concubine's Tattoo (1998)\n5.
