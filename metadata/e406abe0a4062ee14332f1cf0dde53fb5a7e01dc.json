The six are challenged to give up meat, dairy, sugar, alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, soda, junk food, fast food, processed food, packaged food, and even cooked food for 30 days. The film follows each participant's remarkable journey and captures the medical, physical, and emotional transformations brought on by this radical diet and lifestyle change. We witness moments of struggle, support, and hope as what is revealed, with startling clarity, is that diet can reverse disease and change lives.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rawfor30days.com/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rawfor30days.com/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nGreens can save your life!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e406abe0a4062ee14332f1cf0dde53fb5a7e01dc","amp;dn":"Simply+Raw+-+Reversing+Diabetes+in+30+Days+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e406abe0a4062ee14332f1cf0dde53fb5a7e01dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,6,171,224,164,6,46,225,67,50,241,207,13,222,83,251,90,126,1,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
