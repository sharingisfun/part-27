E. K. Smith, &quot;Source Book of American Architecture: 500 Notable Buildings from the 10th Century to the Present&quot; \n\nEnglish | 1997 | 680 pages | PDF | 22 MB\n\nThe Architecture of the United States, GE Kidder Smith's 1981 three-volume masterwork, was hailed as the most comprehensive and insightful overview of the architectural heritage of this country. Princeton Architectural Press is proud to introduce an updated version of this extraordinary resource-long out of print-in a single volume, the Source Book of American Architecture. No similar encyclopedia of American architecture exists. Kidder Smith examines our nation's architecture from its earliest days to the present, ranging from cliff dwellings in Mesa Verde to Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House in Chicago to James Ingo Freed's Holocaust Museum in Washington. This critical, chronological survey of 500 of America's most distinguished buildings provides a unique overview of the thousand-year architectural development of the United States. Indispensable in the library, it also serves as a splendid guide for the tourist.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f007f0344caa1957f7b44729d15f14bb9b931b5b","amp;dn":"Source+Book+of+American+Architecture+-+500+Notable+Buildings+fro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f007f0344caa1957f7b44729d15f14bb9b931b5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,7,240,52,76,170,25,87,247,180,71,41,209,95,20,187,155,147,27,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
