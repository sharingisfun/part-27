All three have had major influence on him though not the kind that made him what he is today. His former military commander had him court-martialed; his former teacher ridiculed and humiliated him in class after she caught him cheating; and his church Minister who ruined his reputation after he drove a girl to suicide. All he wants from them is one thing: a brief apology. The impact of what they've done is far greater than it appears.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1ac05cb2ccdb50dfd222baed95b17a6145865a7","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+-+One+More+Pallbearer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1ac05cb2ccdb50dfd222baed95b17a6145865a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,172,5,203,44,205,181,13,253,34,43,174,217,91,23,166,20,88,101,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
