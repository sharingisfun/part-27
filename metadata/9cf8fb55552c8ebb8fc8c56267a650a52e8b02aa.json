Now, in King of Thorns, that boyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s journey into manhood takes him to the dark depths waiting within his soulÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nThe boy who would be King has gained the throne...\n\nPrince Honorious Jorg Ancrath vowed when he was nine to avenge his slaughtered mother and brotherÃ¢â‚¬â€and punish his father for not doing so. When he was fifteen, he began to fulfill that vow. Now he is eighteenÃ¢â‚¬â€and he must hold on by strength of arms to what he took by torture and treachery.\n\nKing Jorg is a man haunted: by the ghost of a young boy, by a mysterious copper box, by his desire for the woman who rides with his enemy. Plagued by nightmares of the atrocities he committed, and of the atrocities committed against him when he was a child, he is filled with rage. And even as his need for revenge continues to consume him, twenty thousand men march toward the gates of his castle. His enemy is far stronger than him. Jorg knows that he cannot win a fair fight.\n\nBut he has found, in a chamber hidden beneath the castle, ancient and long-lost artifacts. Some might call them magic. Jorg is not certainÃ¢â‚¬â€all he knows is that the secrets they hold can be put to terrible use in the coming battle...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cf8fb55552c8ebb8fc8c56267a650a52e8b02aa","amp;dn":"King+of+Thorns+-+Mark+Lawrence+EPUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cf8fb55552c8ebb8fc8c56267a650a52e8b02aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,248,251,85,85,44,142,187,143,200,197,98,103,166,80,165,46,139,2,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
