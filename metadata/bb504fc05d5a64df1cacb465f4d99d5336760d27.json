It deals with convex or non-convex bodies and lattices in euclidean space, etc.\n\nThis second edition was prepared jointly by P.M. Gruber and the author of the first edition. The authors have retained the existing text (with minor corrections) while adding to each chapter supplementary sections on the more recent developments. While this method may have drawbacks, it has the definite advantage of showing clearly where recent progress has taken place and in what areas interesting results may be expected in the future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb504fc05d5a64df1cacb465f4d99d5336760d27","amp;dn":"Geometry+of+Numbers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb504fc05d5a64df1cacb465f4d99d5336760d27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,80,79,192,93,90,100,223,28,172,180,101,244,217,157,83,54,118,13,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
