Watching the video on their site explains that it's a new loan/equity line that you use as your operating account (checking account) and you use their program to figure out how much/when to pay.  The new loan is a variable rate... It seems pretty stupid to me to get a variable rate when mortgage rates are at 50 year lows... where do you think the rates are going to go from here?  The honest truth is that you cannot borrow your way out of debt.  The only way to pay off debt faster is to make principle payments and/or lower the interest rate.  For a real, no BS plan on getting out of debt and paying off your mortgage visit &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.daveramsey.com.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.daveramsey.com.&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:903cdd581e03e1ca38965b68e574ba6ef9ebe921","amp;dn":"Jeff.Rense.RadioShow.2009.02.02-chakra71","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"903cdd581e03e1ca38965b68e574ba6ef9ebe921","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,60,221,88,30,3,225,202,56,150,91,104,229,116,186,110,249,235,233,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
