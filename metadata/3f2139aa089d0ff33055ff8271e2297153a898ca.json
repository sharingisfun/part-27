I saw a video of Bly called\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;A Gathering of men\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; in 1991 and that primed me for my\nown work on the mature masculine.\n\nThis Book is about deep Male Identity, the growth from \nboy to man, and how the maturation of men relies on other \nmen more than the approval of women.  Rather than some old \nform of abusive patriarchy, we now grow to a place where \nmen claim their rightful masculine heritage which is \nultimately aligned with the goddess power within women.\n\nIf you wish to investigate more into men\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s work and\nperhaps even attend an experiencial workshop,\ncontact me.  poyball at yahoo dot com.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f2139aa089d0ff33055ff8271e2297153a898ca","amp;dn":"Robert+Bly+-+Iron+John","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f2139aa089d0ff33055ff8271e2297153a898ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,33,57,170,8,157,15,243,48,85,255,130,113,226,41,113,83,168,152,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
