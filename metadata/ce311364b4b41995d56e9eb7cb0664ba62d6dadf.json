Based out of MalmÃƒÂ¶, Sweden, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been together for about six years now. In that time, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve released a couple incredible EPs on the Swedish netlabel Go, Jukebox! and performed live, on and off, in the MalmÃƒÂ¶ region. From the beginning, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve put together a mixture of influences and ideas, however, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re still trying to find their intended style; they have no intensions of ever really doing so. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s five of them in the band, mostly good people Ã¢â‚¬â€ Stefan Bodetoft, Charlotte Fagerlund, Charlotte Lundgren, Birgitta Persson &amp; Patrik Svensson. Their influences are as far-ranging as Curtis Mayfield, Pink Floyd, DÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Angelo, Massive Attack, Gary Numan, The Stooges, Portishead, Emmylou Harris &amp; Wu-Tang Clan.\n\nIf youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re at all familiar with Swedish pop music, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll no doubt already know that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quite infectious. Garmisch is no different. Well over a year in the making, the self-titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“GarmischÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ album captures much of what made both of their previous EPs so special and manages to add to that more polished production and mastering. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re familiar with GarmischÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ previous work, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re guaranteed to thoroughly enjoy it. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re new to Garmisch, this is the perfect place to introduce yourself to their sound.\n\nThanks for taking a moment to visit blocSonic.com and check out the album! As alwaysÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ keep the music movingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ share itÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ blog itÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ podcast it! NowÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ satisfy that sweet tooth with some electrically-charged pop goodness!\n\nPeace\n\nMike Gregoire\n\nFounder/Curator blocSonic.com\n\n\nThis audio is part of the collection: blocSonic\nIt also belongs to collection:\n\nArtist/Composer: Garmisch\nDate: 2010-08-31\nKeywords: blocsonic; garmisch; sweden; electropop; electro-pop; free; music; freemusic; ccmusic; creative commons; flac; ogg; mp3;\n\nCreative Commons license: Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0\n\nIndividual Files\nWhole Item \tFormat\tSize\n00-BSOG0008.pdf.zip \tZIP \t7.0 MB\n00-BSOG0008_192Kbs_MP3.zip \tZIP \t73.9 MB\n00-BSOG0008_320Kbs_MP3.zip \tZIP \t104.4 MB\n00-BSOG0008_Art_EPS_Format.zip \tZIP \t71.2 MB\n00-BSOG0008_Art_PDF_Format.zip \tZIP \t4.4 MB\n00-BSOG0008_Art_TIF_Format.zip \tZIP \t20.2 MB\n00-BSOG0008_FLAC-24Bit.zip \tZIP \t757.2 MB\n00-BSOG0008_FLAC.zip \tZIP \t224.9 MB\n00-BSOG0008_OGG.zip \tZIP \t101.6 MB\nBSXE0004-csw.zip \tZIP \t397.8 MB\nBSXE0004-doingtime.zip \tZIP \t252.0 MB\nBSXE0004-ebrained.zip \tZIP \t153.1 MB\nBSXE0004-fts.zip \tZIP \t316.5 MB\nBSXE0004-glimmer.zip \tZIP \t244.2 MB\nBSXE0004-laughtracks.zip \tZIP \t168.0 MB\nBSXE0004-muenchen.zip \tZIP \t151.5 MB\nBSXE0004-tchp.zip \tZIP \t164.7 MB\nBSXE0004-try01.zip \tZIP \t519.4 MB\nBSXE0004-uddling.zip \tZIP \t246.5 MB\nBSXE0004-ufine.zip \tZIP \t251.0 MB\nBSXE0004-unreal.zip \tZIP \t469.2 MB\nAudio Files \tVBR MP3 \tOgg Vorbis \t192Kbps MP3\n01 - Facing the Sea \t3.6 MB\n\t2.2 MB\n\t6.3 MB\n02 - Try 01 \t3.8 MB\n\t2.3 MB\n\t6.7 MB\n03 - Unreal \t4.8 MB\n\t2.7 MB\n\t7.3 MB\n04 - Uddling \t5.6 MB\n\t2.8 MB\n\t7.9 MB\n05 - Doing Time \t5.6 MB\n\t3.1 MB\n\t8.3 MB\n06 - Laugh Tracks \t2.5 MB\n\t1.3 MB\n\t4.2 MB\n07 - Glimmer \t4.5 MB\n\t2.6 MB\n\t7.3 MB\n08 - The Cultural History of the Penis \t4.4 MB\n\t2.4 MB\n\t6.5 MB\n09 - Courtesy of Steven Wright \t3.1 MB\n\t1.7 MB\n\t4.9 MB\n10 - Ebrained \t4.4 MB\n\t2.8 MB\n\t7.6 MB\nImage Files \tJPEG \tJPEG Thumb\nBSOG0008.jpg \t234.8 KB\n\t5.3 KB\nInformation \tFormat\tSize\nBSOG0008_files.xml \tMetadata \t[file]\nBSOG0008_meta.xml \tMetadata \t2.6 KB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce311364b4b41995d56e9eb7cb0664ba62d6dadf","amp;dn":"%5BBSOG0008%5D+Garmisch+-+Garmisch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce311364b4b41995d56e9eb7cb0664ba62d6dadf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,49,19,100,180,180,25,149,213,110,158,183,203,6,100,186,98,214,218,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
