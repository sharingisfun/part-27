Pipeline Integrity Handbook provides pipeline engineers with the tools to evaluate and inspect pipelines, safeguard the life cycle of their pipeline asset and ensure that they are optimizing delivery and capability. Presented in easy-to-use, step-by-step order, Pipeline Integrity Handbook is a quick reference for day-to-day use in identifying key pipeline degradation mechanisms and threats to pipeline integrity. The book begins with an overview of pipeline risk management and engineering assessment, including data collection and regulatory approaches to liquid pipeline risk management. Other critical integrity issues include:\r\n\r\nPipeline defects and corrective actions\r\nIntroduction to various essential pipeline material such as line pipes and valves\r\nCoverage on corrosion and corrosion protection\r\nIdentifies the key pipeline degradation mechanisms and threats to pipeline integrity\r\nAppreciates various corrosion monitoring and control tools and techniques\r\nUnderstands the principles of risk assessment and be able to conduct a simple risk assessment\r\nDevelops simple Pipeline Integrity Management plans\r\nSelects and apply appropriate inspection and assessment criteria for pipeline defects\r\nRecommends appropriate repair methods for pipeline defects","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48aaaaddc4be4c8eef8970a85a7c5fa34730797e","amp;dn":"Pipeline+Integrity+Handbook+-+Risk+Management+and+Evaluation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48aaaaddc4be4c8eef8970a85a7c5fa34730797e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,170,170,221,196,190,76,142,239,137,112,168,90,124,95,163,71,48,121,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
