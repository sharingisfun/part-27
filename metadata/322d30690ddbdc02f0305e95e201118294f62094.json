Half a dozen seemed to guess at Mrs. ClintonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s eventual running mate, like clintonomalley.com, referring to Gov. Martin OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Malley of Maryland.\n\nThe day after Barack Obama won the Iowa caucuses, the R.N.C. snapped up at least 20 domains related to his candidacy. Some of them may signal the partyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s future strategy: baracknotready.com and norealexperience.com. The party has also begun preemptively registering domains that could be used to attack John McCain, like mccainamigos.com, voteagainstmccain.com, flipflopmccain.com and hatemccain.com (ihatemccain.com was taken.)\n\nThe Democratic Party and the campaigns have shown little of the verve and creativity of the R.N.C. The Obama campaign registered desperatehillaryattacks.com in December. The Clinton campaign registered votingpresent.com two days later, an apparent reference to Mr. ObamaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s votes as a member of the Illinois legislature. The party has been focused more on the national convention, registering variations of denverdemconvention08.com in February, but so far apparently no domains related to Mr. McCain.\n\nThe election has ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtriggered an avalanche of cybersquatter activity,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ according to NetNames, a domain name management service. Speculators have registered nearly 2,000 domain names related to presidential candidates as of last week. Names related to Mrs. ClintonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s candidacy made up over half of the registrations, followed by Mr. Obama with 635 and Mr. McCain with 269.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:322d30690ddbdc02f0305e95e201118294f62094","amp;dn":"Republican+national+convention+domains","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"322d30690ddbdc02f0305e95e201118294f62094","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,45,48,105,13,219,220,2,240,48,94,149,226,1,17,130,148,246,32,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
