Lame I tell you. Took me a week. After unRARing it I found out that it was an ISO file. I ripped the ISO file to a VOB file, then converted it to AVI. Enjoy. Sorry for the file size, it's great quality though. And please SEED for all Fall Out Boy fans that want this.\n\nWikipedia article:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/****_(album)\nDVD Cover: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:FOB_Live_Phoenix_DVD.jpg\n\n   1. &quot;Thriller&quot;\n   2. &quot;Grand Theft Autumn / Where Is Your Boy&quot;\n   3. &quot;Don't Matter&quot; (Akon cover)\n   4. &quot;Sugar, We're Goin Down&quot;\n   5. &quot;Our Lawyer Made Us Change the Name of This Song So We Wouldn't Get Sued&quot;\n   6. &quot;Of All the Gin Joints in All the World&quot;\n   7. &quot;Hum Hallelujah&quot;\n   8. &quot;I Slept with Someone in Fall Out Boy and All I Got Was This Stupid Song Written About Me&quot;\n   9. &quot;Tell That Mick He Just Made My List of Things to Do Today&quot;\n  10. &quot;I'm Like a Lawyer with the Way I'm Always Trying to Get You off (Me &amp; You)&quot;\n  11. &quot;A Little Less Sixteen Candles, a Little More &quot;Touch Me&quot;&quot;\n  12. &quot;Beat It&quot; (Michael Jackson cover)\n  13. &quot;The Carpal Tunnel of Love&quot;\n  14. &quot;Golden&quot;\n  15. &quot;I Write Sins Not Tragedies&quot; (Panic at the Disco cover)\n  16. &quot;This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race&quot;\n  17. &quot;Thnks fr th Mmrs&quot;\n  18. &quot;&quot;The Take Over, the Breaks Over&quot;&quot;\n  19. &quot;One and Only&quot; (Timbaland featuring Fall Out Boy cover)\n  20. &quot;Dance, Dance&quot;\n  21.
