From the very beginning of human existence in this world, they are assigned the religion of their family or the ideology of the state. By the time individuals reach their teens they usually accept the beliefs of their parents or that of their particular society.\nHowever, when some people mature and are exposed to other beliefs and ideologies, they begin to question the validity of their own beliefs, and search for the truth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b37f7b365e987f545b3adffc0ab6bb812cadf01","amp;dn":"Islam+Is+Your+Birthright","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b37f7b365e987f545b3adffc0ab6bb812cadf01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,55,247,179,101,233,135,245,69,179,173,255,192,171,107,184,18,202,223,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
