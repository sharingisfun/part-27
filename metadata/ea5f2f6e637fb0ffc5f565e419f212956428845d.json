Dave Dwyer joined on guitars and keyboards and 1927 recorded The Other Side with Weideman as main songwriter and Fisher and Garry Frost producing.[1] The album, which peaked at #3 in July 1990, provided a Top 20 hit with &quot;Tell Me a Story&quot;.[3] McFarlane described the album as &quot;full of lush, ambitious arrangements and well-crafted pop, but it lacked the charm and rousing choruses&quot; of ...ish.[1] Drummer Barton left in 1992 to be replaced by Phil Campbell,[2] they released their eponymous third album, 1927 produced by Mark Opitz, in November. 1927 just peeked into the Top 40 and the associated singles were less successful.[3] 1927 were suffering financial and internal problems and disbanded in 1993.[1] A compilation album titled The Very Best of 1927 was released in 1996.[2] Weideman subsequently pursued a solo career releasing a single &quot;Nothing I Can Do&quot; in 1996.\n\nA digitally remastered edition of ...ish featuring bonus live recordings of &quot;Propaganda Machine&quot; and &quot;Compulsory Hero&quot; was released in 2009. The band, featuring a new lineup led by Weideman, appeared on Mornings with Kerri-Anne on 17 June 2009 and toured Australia in during the latter half of 2009 and the start of 2010, culminating in a performance in Sydney as support for Simple Minds in March 2010. The second leg of the 20...ish Anniversary Tour began in June 2010. According to their official website they are currently recording their 1st album of new material since 1992's self titled album.
