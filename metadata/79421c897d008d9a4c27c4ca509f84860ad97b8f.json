I'd certainly rate this as the best punk album of 2011 so far. Ought to appeal to fans of off-the-wall rock music too. Enjoy.\n\n12 tracks, 256kbps mp3.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79421c897d008d9a4c27c4ca509f84860ad97b8f","amp;dn":"Antonella%5C%27s+Klasse+Kriminale+-+Phoenix+%282011%29+oi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79421c897d008d9a4c27c4ca509f84860ad97b8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,66,28,137,125,0,141,154,76,39,196,202,80,159,132,134,10,217,123,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
