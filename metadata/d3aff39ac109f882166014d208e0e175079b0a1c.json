Here, Pinker talks about his thesis, and why some people found it incredibly upsetting.\n\nSteven PinkerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s books have been like bombs tossed into the eternal nature-versus-nurture debate. Pinker asserts that not only are human minds predisposed to certain kinds of learning, such as language, but that from birth our minds -- the patterns in which our brain cells fire -- predispose us each to think and behave differently.\n\nHis deep studies of language have led him to insights into the way that humans form thoughts and engage our world. He argues that humans have evolved to share a faculty for language, the same way a spider evolved to spin a web. We arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t born with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œblank slatesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to be shaped entirely by our parents and environment, he argues in books including The Language Instinct; How the Mind Works; and The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature.\n\nIn 2003, Harvard recruited Pinker for its psychology department from MIT. Time magazine named Pinker one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2004. His latest book is The Stuff of Thought, previewed at TEDGlobal 2005. He is working on a new book that studies violence. \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nplease leave a comment if you want, this is just to show what is out there...\nAnd before you go and spam, dl it watch it and make up your own mind...\ncheers the_phyrexian\n\nAre you a British citizen?
