In five books that span seven years, Colwell delivers a variety of gritty stories with gripping characters that reflect his life in Oakland, California, his two years in prison, and a lifetime of keen perception about life on the city streets.\n\nToday's youth culture talks about &quot;keepin' it real.&quot; Guy Colwell never failed to keep it real. Inner City Romance is caustic, raw, funny, daring and highly recommended.\n\nGuy Colwell Wiki... &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Colwell&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Colwell&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs a side effect of the restoration process, depending on what you are using to view this file, you may need to reduce the image size in order to achieve the best possible quality. On a smaller screen you'll never notice it, but if you are viewing on a full size monitor the file will open a bit too large. Just shrink it a little and enjoy!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:779a0c30d24b184d15bb0e283297dffe0f34a58c","amp;dn":"Inner+City+Romance+%28Underground+-+Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"779a0c30d24b184d15bb0e283297dffe0f34a58c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,154,12,48,210,75,24,77,21,187,14,40,50,151,223,254,15,52,165,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
