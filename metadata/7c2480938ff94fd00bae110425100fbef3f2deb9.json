Crumb &amp; His Cheap Suit Serenaders, for which he sang lead vocals, wrote several songs and played banjo and other instruments. Crumb often plays mandolin with Eden and John's East River String Band and has drawn three covers for them: 2009's &quot;Drunken Barrel House Blues,&quot; 2008's &quot;Some Cold Rainy Day,&quot; and 2011's &quot;Be Kind To A Man When He's Down&quot; which he also plays mandolin on. He has also been a member of Les Primitifs du Futur and played on (and drew the cover of) that band's 2000 album &quot;World Musette&quot;.[24]\n\nCrumb has also released CDs anthologizing old original performances gleaned from collectible 78 RPM phonograph records. His &quot;That's What I Call Sweet Music&quot; was released in 1999. His &quot;Hot Women: Women Singers from the Torrid Regions&quot; was released in 2009. Naturally, Crumb drew the cover art for these CDs as well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c2480938ff94fd00bae110425100fbef3f2deb9","amp;dn":"R+Crumb+and+his+cheap+suit+serenaders+-++Chasin+Rainbows","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c2480938ff94fd00bae110425100fbef3f2deb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,36,128,147,143,249,79,208,11,174,17,4,37,16,15,190,243,242,222,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
