ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 6 weeksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ worth of high-intensity interval workouts Ã¢â‚¬â€ 8 routines in all Ã¢â‚¬â€ that blend calisthenics, weight training, and cutting-edge cardio techniques into a fat-torching, muscle-sculpting, sweat-drenching total-body transformation.\n\nHERE'S WHY YOUÃ¢â‚¬â„¢LL GET THE BODY YOU WANT!\n\nYou donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to make your life fit this program; THE ANARCHY WORKOUT is 100% designed to fit your life.\n\nTo do THE ANARCHY WORKOUT, all you need is a pair of dumbbells and 30 minutes, 3 days a week\n\nMax out your calorie burn!\n\nA recent study from Auburn University found that a high-intensity metabolic workout, like Anarchy, burned up to 16 calories per minute. That means one Anarchy Workout is the calorie-crushing equivalent of boxing an opponent for 30 minutes straight.\n\nPush your body to the limit!\n\nUniversity of Georgia researchers discovered that an Anarchy-style high-intensity total-body workout Ã¢â‚¬Å“induced vigorous metabolic and cardiovascular responsesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that were similar to an all-out sprint workout.\n\nWith these fast but incredibly effective 30-minute workouts, you can do the follow-along videos without ever leaving your home. No travel time to the gym. No waiting for equipment. No procrastinating. Once you hit play, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in it Ã¢â‚¬â€ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just you, your sweat, and an all-out revolt against body fat.
