Comedian Bobby Kelly sits poolside with Anthony to go over the now infamous &quot;Time Square incident&quot; which leads into convos about past fights, prison verses juvenile hall, and Bobby's theory that most rock stars speak &quot;half-queer&quot;. Bobby fill us in on his upcoming FX show, they debate who gets the most pussy in a rock band, talk about hecklers and bullies, and Bobby admits that parenthood has made him &quot;cheesy&quot;. No, that's not a fat joke. They finish up the show talking about porn, silent fucking and jerking off, and the evolution of O&amp;A and the comics that have been on the show. Side Note: Be on the lookout for Bobby's one-hour special, &quot;Live at the Village Underground&quot;.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b3a2a9563ae4787db95fbc5ad69a47c56fcc715","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-08-25.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b3a2a9563ae4787db95fbc5ad69a47c56fcc715","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,58,42,149,99,174,71,135,219,149,251,197,173,105,164,124,86,252,199,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
