But Brian has spent his whole life being the invisible man, and he's used to looking below the surface. What he sees in Talker is a fragile and lovable human being.Brian is outwardly straight, but Talker is desperate for love, and when Talker's behavior leads to some painful consequences, Brian is forced to come out of his closet-in dramatic fashion. He'll do anything to make sure Talker sees that he's the Prince Charming Talker has always needed.\n\nTalker's Rdemption\nTate Walker's past is too painful to just disappear, even if his dream boy, Brian Cooper, is there to hold his hand. Brian does his best, but Talker-always good at avoiding his own pain-is having a hard time facing the truth about what happened when he trusted the wrong man at the wrong time. When that truth resurfaces and lands Brian in the hospital, Talker is forced to make a choice. He can either confront every demon in his fragile, bleeding heart, or he can let Brian take the heat for him, just like he has from the beginning. But even Talker knows you don't leave your dream boy alone and undefended when he just saved your life, and he'll have to find the strength to take care of Brian when Brian needs him the most.\n\nTalker's Graduation\nWhen you get past the basics of survival, what next? Brian Cooper recovered from the attack that almost killed him, and Tate Walker faced down his own demons. Now all thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s left is... each other. Growing up together and growing into their love is everything but easy.\nTalkerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eternal optimism and BrianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quiet faith just might be able to conquer the obstacles, big and small, in their wayÃ¢â‚¬â€as well as overcome the complications of having all their dreams come true","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7f63a2f77eefaddc0bcaf4b73dff8c90f87116c","amp;dn":"Talker+%281-3%29+Talker%2C+Talker%26rsquo%3Bs+Redemption%2C+Talker%26rsquo%3Bs+G","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7f63a2f77eefaddc0bcaf4b73dff8c90f87116c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,246,58,47,119,238,250,221,192,188,175,75,115,223,248,201,15,135,17,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
