Upbeat, funny and sung (like the first album) in lilys unique style but, because of the length between first and second album sounds just as fresh as the first time you heard her .. .. A feel good album , i can`t stop listening to it .. Have a go yourselves and i`m sure you won`t be dissapointed !!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:600acb6691d600cdc2fdf96972bc346585af7a22","amp;dn":"Lily+Allen+-+It%5C%27s+Not+Me+It%5C%27s+You+320Kbps+-+P0w3rp0t1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"600acb6691d600cdc2fdf96972bc346585af7a22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,10,203,102,145,214,0,205,194,253,249,105,114,188,52,101,133,175,122,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
