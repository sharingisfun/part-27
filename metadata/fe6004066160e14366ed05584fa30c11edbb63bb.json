Just like photoshop.\n------------------------------\n\nWhat this avi in fact is, is a near-duplicate/de-interlaced version of the reconstruction/re-release of Tony Palmer's extraordinary (ha!) documentary about Leonard Cohen's 1972 European tour, one or the other of which (tour or documentary) is or was, and this sentence is already WAY TOO LONG so I won't look it up, entitled &quot;Bird On A Wire&quot;.\n\n[What a pitiful adjective Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ &quot;extraordinary&quot;. Could use someone like that Cohen fellow to write a proper review.]\n\nUnfortunately the &quot;exact&quot; match is so blatantly interlaced I had to interrupt the process and start all over again so as to include a de-interlace operation which had to run simultaneously with the sizing operation in order that the desired number of encodings (ie. 1) be maintained.\n\nNow, unfortunately, in order for you to fully appreciate both the conundrum detailed below as well as the importance of preserving, as much as possible, this film's original content, you actually need to view quite a bit of it. Also, I ran out of words about 2 paragraphs ago.\n\nBut anyway, for me, about half way through maybe, I realized that Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ er.. that somehow, through performing a familiar series of mindless, mechanical operations there I was, suddenly in possession a kind of &quot;thing&quot; (the video) very obviously of *tremendous* value. Of an incalculable value! A value well in excess of any dollar amount I can think of. And there this thing sits, my so-called &quot;perfect offering&quot; marred horrendously with what started to look like dark crayon lines. And of course growing darker and larger with the &quot;thing&quot;s ever-growing incalculable value.\n\nI have to mention how I (and you could too) found the DVD source for this RIP. The way to find it is to keep trying all the various duds out there until one of them eventually works (maybe). I forget which one it was. They all have the same name but different hashes. So you'd have to remember the hash. Anyway, the one I found will certainly die out soon enough.\n\nWhy? Because nobody (and for good reason) wants any .BUP's or .IFO's or .VOB's or .CUE's or .ETC's and all the hassle that implies. Like, for instance the near-certain failure to produce a working plastic?!?! disk because you're in the wrong country or something. And nobody has the patience or the months required to figure out how to properly form an XviD/Avi from a collection of &quot;.FUK's&quot; Right?  Right?\n\nI would feel the same way too, except I happen to be one of those idiots who's already wasted all that time.\n\nSo by logical deduction it must die and I must replace it.\n\nAs for the rest? Hey, I'm not LC!\n\nBUT I SHOULD ADD THIS WARNING:\n------------------------------\nSome of this film's VISUAL content IS HIGHLY DISTURBING. Be forewarned that nothing has been edited out to protect you from seeing things that, in all honesty, nobody should ever have to see. So please be very careful if you are sensitive certain types of (especially &quot;war&quot;) imagery. Maybe have someone else look ahead for you. Personally, I had to look away at one point.\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Details\n-------------\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Bird On A Wire (Film 1972).XviD.AC3.HDTV.720p.avi\nFormat                                   : AVI\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat profile                           : OpenDML\nFile size                                : 4.55 GiB\nDuration                                 : 1h 44mn\nOverall bit rate                         : 6 249 Kbps\nWriting library                          : VirtualDub build 32842/release\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 0\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                           : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP                    : No\nFormat settings, QPel                    : No\nFormat settings, GMC                     : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix                  : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 1h 44mn\nBit rate                                 : 5 982 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                                   : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.217\nStream size                              : 4.36 GiB (96%)\nWriting library                          : XviD 63\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AC-3\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                           : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness              : Big\nCodec ID                                 : 2000\nDuration                                 : 1h 44mn\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 256 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 191 MiB (4%)\nAlignment                                : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration                     : 33 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration             : 500 ms\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe6004066160e14366ed05584fa30c11edbb63bb","amp;dn":"Leonard.Cohen.Bird.On.A.Wire.1972.Film.Tony.Palmer.XviD.AC3.HDTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe6004066160e14366ed05584fa30c11edbb63bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,96,4,6,97,96,225,67,102,237,5,88,79,163,12,17,237,187,99,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
