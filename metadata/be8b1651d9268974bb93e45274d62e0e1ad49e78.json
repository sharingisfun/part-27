All 6 of her classic disco albums recorded for the Ariola label between the years 1977 and 1983, some rarities, alternate versions and mixes plus recent interpretations of her greatest hits.\n\nQuick bio for those of you out there who for some strange reason still don't know who Amanda Lear is; born sometime in the late 1930s or early 1940s - nobody knows for sure - in Hong Kong, Saigon or Oslo - nobody knows for sure - to English / French / Chinese / Russian / Mongolian parents - nobody knows for sure. Grew up in Nice in the south of France with mother, a seamstress. Strict religious, Catholic upbringing. Fluent in five languages: English, French, German, Italian and Spanish. \n\nRelocated to Paris sometime in the early 60s to study art at L'Academie des Beaux Arts. Discovered by legendary modelling agent Catherine HarlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© in 1965. Top model in Paris and London working for among others Coco Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent, Ossie Clarke, Anthony Price, Mary Quant and Paco Rabanne all through the 60s and early 70s. Photographed by Helmut Newton, Charles Paul Wilp, Antoine Giacomoni, Brian Duffy and Andy Warhol, all impressed with her exotic Eurasian features and tall stature. International jetsetter hobnobbing with the rich and famous - and dreaded gossip columnist for David Bailey and David Litchfield's glossy 'Ritz Magazine' in London. Best pals with Marianne Faithfull, Pattie Boyd and Anita Pallenberg. Surrealist painter Salvador DalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­'s mistress and muse for fifteen years, later described their relationship as a &quot;spiritual marriage&quot;. Wrote authorised biography 'My Life with DalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­', published in twenty-five languages. Also romantically linked to Guinness heir Tara Browne (immortalised in the Beatles' &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;), Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones (&quot;Miss Amanda Jones&quot; from 1967's 'Between the Buttons' allegedly written about her), Bryan Ferry of Roxy Music (pictured on front cover of 1973 album 'For Your Pleasure' with black panther) and David Bowie, the latter who persuaded her to launch a career in music: &quot; - With a voice like that... you sound like Marlene Dietrich or Zarah Leander...you have to.&quot; \n\nDebut single &quot;Trouble&quot; (cover of Elvis Presley classic from movie 'Jailhouse Rock')b/w &quot;Lethal Leading Lady&quot; released in 1975 on minor UK label Creole Records, flopped. Big time. Re-recorded A-side with French lyrics in 1976, re-titled &quot;La Bagarre&quot;. Single re-released on Polydor in France and Belgium, bombed again - but became a surprise disco hit in West Germany. After first appearance on music show 'Musikladen' with &quot;La Bagarre&quot; signed by Ariola Records Germany for &quot;astronomical sum of money&quot;. Second single &quot;Blood and Honey&quot; produced by Anthony Monn Top 10 hit throughout Continental Europe and Scandinavia. Went on to record a series of pop-rock-disco-postdisco albums in Munich with the same musicians and arrangers as Donna Summer, Giorgio Moroder, Boney M. and Silver Convention, among them Sylvester Levay, Rainer Pietsch, Harold Faltermeyer and Keith Forsey. Wrote all lyrics and some of the music herself. Sold some 30 million albums worldwide and signature tune &quot;Follow Me&quot; which charted in 42 countries 2 million copies alone. Somehow never made it big in either the UK or the US, but crowned a Disco Queen in the rest of the world. A couple of characteristics however clearly set Lear apart from the other Queens: she was 6ft/183 cm tall, broad-shouldered and, most significantly, she had that deeeeeeeep baritone voice. Posed nude for Playboy in 1977 and Lui in 1983 saying &quot;....and they could see I was a woman like everybody else....&quot;. Still the rumours persist: Amanda Lear or 'L'Amant DalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­' ('DalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­'s Lover') was once somebody else. Entirely. Think &quot;Lady Gaga&quot; and &quot;certain rumour&quot;, only forty-seven years ago..... Again - and still - nobody knows for sure.\n\nAlong with ABBA and Boney M. one of the very few Western artists to have her music approved and officially released in the Soviet Union by state-owned record company Melodiya, longlasting popularity throughout the entire Eastern Bloc ever since. Cover art for 1980 album 'Diamonds for Breakfast' designed by Pierre &amp; Gilles. Striking physical resemblance to British actress and fellow 60s top model Joanna Lumley. Facial resemblance. Turned down the offer of playing the part of Patsy Stone in French film adaptation of 'Absolutely Fabulous' by saying she had &quot;already lived it&quot;.... Cited as inspiration by among others Marc Almond, the Pet Shop Boys and Boy George (who remixed her recent single &quot;Someone Else's Eyes&quot;). Novelist, painter, actress, comedienne, beloved and celebrated but outspoken and sometimes controversial media personality and talk show host in France and Italy since the mid-1980s. Known for her razor-sharp intelligence and acerbic wit but also for her self-deprecating sense of humour. Constant source of punchy one-liners like &quot; - I hate spreading rumours but what else are you supposed to do with them?&quot;.\n\nMarried French artistocrat Alain-Philippe Malagnac d'Argens de VillÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨le in Las Vegas in 1979 and settled down in Provence, tragically widowed in 2000. Complicated relationship with German publishing/record company Siebenpunkt Verlags GmbH/Mint Records who keeps releasing cheap CD compilations of re-recordings of her disco hits (see below) once, twice, sometimes three times a year - recently even via iTunes. Has taken concepts like 'kitsch' and 'ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼bercamp' and quite literally turned them into fine art. 2006 exhibition in London, Paris and New York tellingly entitled 'Never Mind the Bollocks: Here's Amanda Lear!'. Decorated with prestigious award 'Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Arts et Lettres' by the French Ministre of Culture in 2007 in recognition of her significant contributions to the arts and literature. Recently published autobiography 'Je ne suis pas celle que vous croyez' ('I'm not the one you think I am') without a single word about her life before 1965. Attagirl!\n\nStill recording and still going strong.  \n\nLa Reine Lear - la Regina Lear - la Reina Lear - KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶nigin Lear - Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â·Ãƒâ€˜Ã…â€™ Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬.\n\nThe iconic, enigmatic and absolutely fa-fa-fa-faaaaaaaaaaabulous Queen Lear. Long may she reign. Vive la difference! Viva la Diva!\n\n\nTRACK LISTING\n\nI Am a Photograph +  (1977)\n============================\n01. Blood and Honey\n02.
