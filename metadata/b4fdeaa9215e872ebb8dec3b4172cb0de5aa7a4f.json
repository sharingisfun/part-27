By comparison Ritsos is demotic and earthy)\n\nThis is the Caedmon recording from the early sixties with eight poems read alternately in Greek and English by the poet himself and his English translator Edmund Keeley.\n\nCavafy is more transparent. But note that the surface ease of most English translations makes them prosier than the originals and conceals a fair amount of their poetry.\n\nOne's sense is that Cavafy has simply taken hold of a thread, in subject matter and style, that was left by the Alexandrian poets two millennia ago (Callimachus, Theocritus etc.) It helps  that modern Greek is as distant from that of classical Athens, as Chaucer and Langland are from that of modern England.\n\nI have tried to find a reading in Greek for each reading I have in English. Go to http://www.snhell/lections/writers.asp for a large collection of Cavafy poems read in Greek. (Other authors are available Ã¢â‚¬â€œ cl. Translate, if you have to Ã¢â‚¬â€œ then cl. Author name. Cl. the poem title and in the pop up box right cl. the black rectangle. Cl. 'Save Video as' and an mp3 of the poem will download)\n\nFor the complete text of his poetry, in Greek and in English, go to www.cavafy.com. And for more of the poetry of both Seferis and Cavafy type 'Greece' and 'Thus Spake the City' in a torrent search box. This will get you excellent documentaries by Yannis Smaragdis on both poets (Alexandria for Cavafy and Poros and Delphi for Seferis).\n\nAlso included are features on Greek poetry from the ABC, the BBC and RTE.
