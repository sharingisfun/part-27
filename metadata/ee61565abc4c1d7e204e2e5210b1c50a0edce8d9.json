Meanwhile, as the team continues to investigate the Bruce Johnson case, they discover Korean-scripted documents in JohnsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house as well as in the mechanicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quarters aboard the Brewer, thereby connecting the two attacks and suggesting the North Koreans could be behind it all. However, the team realizes the Korean script is merely a front for coded instructions of where to attack and when by an unknown employer. NCIS Agent and former GibbÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ© Stan Burley contacts the team about the discovery of thermite in Italy and suggests the next attack might go down onboard a nuclear aircraft carrier stationed there. Tony and Ziva jet off to Italy and pose as crewmen aboard the ship in order to capture the arsonist, who admits to being hired by Harper Dearing, CEO of a technology empire. When Gibbs tries to arrest Dearing at his corporate office, it turns out the man hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been seen or heard from in over a year, and suddenly, Dearing has become NCISÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ most wanted man.\n\n\n\nThe file specs are pretty standard:\n\ncirca 349 MB\n624x352 px\nXviD\nVirtualDubMod 1.5.10.3 - no longer using packed bitstream \n128kbps vbr mp3\nsourced from that mecca from whence the WEB-DL was born.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee61565abc4c1d7e204e2e5210b1c50a0edce8d9","amp;dn":"NCIS.s09e22.WEB-DL.XviD-jAh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee61565abc4c1d7e204e2e5210b1c50a0edce8d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,97,86,90,188,76,29,126,32,78,46,82,16,177,197,10,14,220,232,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
