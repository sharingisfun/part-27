That's 21 different workouts. You will never be bored.\n\nWe shot in two different locations this season. The first 5 shows were shot in Jerusalem. If you have never seen these shows you have to download them. The location is directly in front of Mount Zion, King David's tomb and the building where the last supper was held. Off to the right barely visible is the Dead Sea. The next series of shows we refer to as our beach party shows on Ala Moana Beach with a live band. Then there is a final series of shows in a slightly different location on Ala Moana Beach.\n\nThere are more interesting people in this season's shows. In the Jerusalem shows the only other exerciser you will recognize is Gilad's mother Ora. The rest are fitness professionals from Israel that trained with Gilad for the show. Also in these shows is an incredibly interesting Middle East band called the Gibberish Group. There is also a traditional exotic dancer and a couple of nomads with their camel off to the side. At Ala Moana Beach Gilad is joined by Jack and Elaine LaLanne for 3 shows. There is also a live band called the Pagan Babies and exercise regulars Wendee, Bill, Tracey, Kent, Lian and Felicia who is 3 months pregnant. We had a hula dancer with the Pagan Babies. There is an on-set visit by Tracey's baby boy and if you look real close...you can see Gilad's father Harold exercising knee deep in the ocean.\n\nThis season you will see a camel and a lot of macaws. One of the macaws is named Ku'uipo which means sweetheart in Hawaiian.\n\nThe 1100 series is like one big party. Live bands, dancers and 21 complete fun workouts.\n\nVideo; x264; 640*480 (4:3); 2274 kbps; 29.970 fps\nAudio; aac; 160 kbps; 2 ch; 48.0 Khz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bceb6ca646723bb07a01adfc792bf48ed073640","amp;dn":"Bodies+in+Motion+1100+Series+with+Gilad+VODRip+x264+aac+%5BMP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bceb6ca646723bb07a01adfc792bf48ed073640","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,206,182,202,100,103,35,187,7,160,26,223,199,146,191,72,237,7,54,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
