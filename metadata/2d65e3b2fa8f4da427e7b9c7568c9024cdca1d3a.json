So when heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s offered a case from wealthy construction mogul Gabriel Kravitz, he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t refuse. \n\nKravitzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eighteen-year-old daughter Lydia has gone missing. Though sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s presumed to be with Jerry Pedrosian, the radical middle-aged artist and known womanizer sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been sleeping with, there are few clues. Information is hard to come by; everyone seems to be hiding something. And then thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Andrea Marshall, LydiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s miniskirted and vinyl-booted best friend, who Novalis is deeply distrustful ofÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and unfortunately attracted to.\n\nBut as Novalis traverses the city, tracking Lydia from scummy artistsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ lofts in pre-gentrified SoHo to luxury penthouses overlooking Central Park, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll face threats deadlier than any he signed on for. \n\nSmart and sophisticated, Good Girl, Bad Girl provides a rare, fascinating snapshot of late 1960s New York CityÃ¢â‚¬â€a glimpse into the forbidden sex, politics, art, drugs, and counterculture violence that ran rampant in its once gloriously gritty streets.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d65e3b2fa8f4da427e7b9c7568c9024cdca1d3a","amp;dn":"Good+Girl%2C+Bad+Girl+-+Christopher+Finch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d65e3b2fa8f4da427e7b9c7568c9024cdca1d3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,101,227,178,250,143,77,164,39,231,185,199,86,140,144,36,205,202,29,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
