Because of this, both beginners and experienced programmers alike can use this book to quickly and effectively learn the fundamentals of Objective-C. Readers can also learn the concepts of object-oriented programming without having to first learn all of the intricacies of the underlying procedural language (C).\n\nThis unique approach to learning, combined with many small program examples and exercises at the end of each chapter, makes Programming in Objective-C ideally suited for either classroom use or self-study. While the Objective-C language itself has gone through little change since the introduction of Objective-C 2.0, the Apple development tools that programmers use for Objective-C development on the Mac and on iOS have changed significantly in a very short period of time.\n\nThe third edition of Programming in Objective-C includes numerous updates and improvements throughout the book:\n\nImproved organization for some chapters\nIncorporation of feedback and suggestions from members of the author's forum for readers, including more detailed descriptions for some of the examples\nA new introduction to blocks with examples\nReplacement of deprecated methods with newer methods\nUpdated diagrams and steps for using Xcode 4\nFrom the Back Cover\nProgramming in Objective-C, Third Edition\nAn introduction to the Objective-C language for iOS and Mac OS X development\n\nStephen G.

The book does not assume previous experience with either C or object-oriented programming languages, and it includes many detailed, practical examples of how to put Objective-C to use in your everyday programming needs.\n\nThe third edition of Programming in Objective-C features updated and expanded coverage of the latest developments in Objective-C as well as new tools such as Xcode 4.
