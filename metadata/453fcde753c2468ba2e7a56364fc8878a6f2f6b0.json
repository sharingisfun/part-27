At the end of the 20th century, two of those albums -- Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975) and Hotel California -- ranked among the ten best-selling albums ever, and the popularity of 2007's Long Road Out of Eden proved the Eagles' staying power in the new millennium. Though most of its members came from outside California, the group was closely identified with a country- and folk-tinged sound that initially found favor in Los Angeles during the late '60s, as championed by such bands as the Flying Burrito Brothers and Poco (both of which contributed members to the Eagles). But the band also drew upon traditional rock &amp; roll styles and, in their later work, helped define the broadly popular rock sound that became known as classic rock. As a result, the Eagles achieved a perennial appeal among generations of music fans who continued to buy their records many years after they had split up, which helped inspire the first of the Eagles' reunions in the mid-'90s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:453fcde753c2468ba2e7a56364fc8878a6f2f6b0","amp;dn":"Eagles+24bit+Vinyl+Pack+Vol+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"453fcde753c2468ba2e7a56364fc8878a6f2f6b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,63,205,231,83,194,70,139,162,231,165,99,100,252,136,120,166,242,246,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
