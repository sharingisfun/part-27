In the wake of the Fail Decade, Americans have historically low levels of trust in their institutions; the social contract between ordinary citizens and elites lies in tatters.\n\nHow did we get here? With Twilight of the Elites, Christopher Hayes offers a radically novel answer. Since the 1960s, as the meritocracy elevated a more diverse group of men and women into power, they learned to embrace the accelerating inequality that had placed them near the very top. Their ascension heightened social distance and spawned a new American eliteÃ¢â‚¬â€one more prone to failure and corruption than any that came before it.\n\nMixing deft political analysis, timely social commentary, and deep historical understanding, Twilight of the Elites describes how the society we have come to inhabit Ã¢â‚¬â€œ utterly forgiving at the top and relentlessly punitive at the bottom Ã¢â‚¬â€œ produces leaders who are out of touch with the people they have been trusted to govern. Hayes argues that the public's failure to trust the federal government, corporate America, and the media has led to a crisis of authority that threatens to engulf not just our politics but our day-to-day lives.\n\nUpending well-worn ideological and partisan categories, Hayes entirely reorients our perspective on our times. Twilight of the Elites is the defining work of social criticism for the post-bailout age.\n\nMeet the Author\nChristopher Hayes is Editor at Large of The Nation and host of Up w/ Chris Hayes on MSNBC.
