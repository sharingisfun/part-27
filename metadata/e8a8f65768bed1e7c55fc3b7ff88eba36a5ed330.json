Needless to say, I can't exactly guarantee any sort of consistent encoding across songs, but most are 128kbps mp3 at worst.\n\nAll of the other Pokemon ost collections I've seen are missing most of the recent songs from the anime(generally anything from the start of AG onward), some BGM, and several movie soundtracks. This collection has as many of those missings songs as I could possibly find(along with all the other anime songs). There are also some random older songs I've found that aren't on previous ost collections.\n\nIn an effort to reduce the size of the collection, most duplicate songs and some TV size/karaoke versions of openings &amp; endings have been omitted - so if it seems like some albums are missing songs, that's the reason why.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8a8f65768bed1e7c55fc3b7ff88eba36a5ed330","amp;dn":"Pokemon+Music+Collection+%28Hyper+Updated+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8a8f65768bed1e7c55fc3b7ff88eba36a5ed330","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,168,246,87,104,190,209,231,197,95,195,183,255,136,235,163,106,94,211,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
