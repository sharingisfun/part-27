Amen!  That amounts to over 60 gigabytes of music, and an impressive 814 Christian releases so far to date.  And counting.\n\nAs always my goal, I hope to reach 1000 titles by the end of the year.  And with four more months to go, and only 186 titles shy of that 1000 goal, it seems safe to say that we will surpass 1000 yet again this year.\n\nFor anyone new to these &quot;The Year In Christian Music&quot; bundles, I started them back in 2011.  I got a late start that year, and because of limited time and bandwidth, I was only able to share 36 bundles amounting to 964 releases for 2011.  A mere 36 titles shy of 1000.\n\nWe fared so much better in 2012 where we shared 55 bundles, which accounted for 1461 releases.  Well surpassing that 1000 goal.\n\nSo whether we hit 1000 this year, or if we even do better than the 1461 we shared last year, please remember that it only takes one album, no one song, or even one lyric to turn someone onto Christ.  And if we've been able to achieve that even once since 2011, then we can all take comfort in knowing the Lord has used us all in reaching that objective for His glory.\n\nBundle 30 includes the following 30 releases...\n\n * Alex Decker - 2013 - Acoustic Sessions\n * Anthem Lights - 2013 - Heart Attack - Single\n * Audrey Assad - 2013 - Fortunate Fall\n * Band Justus, The - 2013 - The Band Justus\n * Cedar And The Sparrow, The - 2013 - Front Porch Revival\n * Chad Lawson - 2013 - The Space Between\n * Chris Burrink - 2013 - Playground\n * Cornerstone Sanctuary Choir - 2013 - Glorify\n * Daniel Amos - 2013 - Dig Here Said The Angel\n * Derek Minor - 2013 - Gimme - Single\n * Digital Age, The - 2013 - Evening Morning\n * Generation Unleashed - 2013 - Top 10 Generation Unleashed\n * Glen Campbell - 2013 - See You There\n * Isaacs, The - 2013 - The Living Years\n * J Sells - 2013 - Goodies\n * J Sells - 2013 - Relinquished\n * Jars of Clay - 2013 - Road To Nowhere - Single\n * Kingdom - 2013 - Just A Soul\n * Marcus Young - 2013 - The Good News\n * Miss Angie - 2013 - The Casting Down Of Demonic Angels EP\n * My Silent Wake - 2013 - Silver Under Midnight\n * New Life Worship - 2013 - Jesus Reigns\n * Norma Jean - 2013 - Wrongdoers\n * Oak Ridge Boys - 2013 - 40th Anniversary\n * Phanatik - 2013 - The Lost Files Of Phanatik\n * Poor Old Lu - 2013 - The Great Unwound - Single\n * Sakis Gouzonis - 2013 - Spiritual Unity\n * Set For The Fall - 2013 - From Darkness To Light EP\n * Startled By Silence - 2013 - The EP\n * Texas In July - 2013 - Reflections\n\nFor His Glory,\nTorrentTracts - August 2013\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:992f9209e6f84ec6d5c99020f13af36920fff78b","amp;dn":"2013+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+30%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"992f9209e6f84ec6d5c99020f13af36920fff78b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,47,146,9,230,248,78,198,213,201,144,32,241,58,243,105,32,255,247,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
