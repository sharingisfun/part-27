It offers a comic depiction of Hollywood, and its transition from silent films to &quot;talkies.&quot;\nAlthough it was a big hit when first released, it was not accorded its legendary status by contemporary critics. It is now frequently described as one of the best musicals ever made,[1] topping the AFI's 100 Years of Musicals list, and ranking fifth in its updated list of the greatest American films in 2007.\n\n\nDirected by\tGene Kelly\nStanley Donen\nProduced by\tArthur Freed\nWritten by\tBetty Comden\nAdolph Green\nStarring\tGene Kelly\nDonald O'Connor\nDebbie Reynolds\nJean Hagen\nMusic by\tNacio Herb Brown (music)\nArthur Freed (lyrics)\nCinematography\tHarold Rosson\nEditing by\tAdrienne Fazan\nDistributed by\tMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer\nRelease date(s)\tMarch 27, 1952\nRunning time\t103 minutes\nCountry\tUnited States\nLanguage\tEnglish\nBudget\tUS$2,540,800&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2009736d87cf2bcf30d0dda99c60bb5d6265d38f","amp;dn":"Singin%5C%27+in+the+Rain+%281952%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2009736d87cf2bcf30d0dda99c60bb5d6265d38f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,9,115,109,135,207,43,207,48,208,221,169,156,96,187,93,98,101,211,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
