It was recorded by Boston alternative rock group Boys Like Girls. It is included on their second studio album Love Drunk, which was released in 2009. The song is the second official single from the album. It features Taylor Swift, the first time that the country pop artist has been involved in a hit single as a featured rather than main artist.\n\nDue to both of their rising popularity, the song has become Boys Like Girls' third, and second consecutive, Top 40 single on the Billboard Hot 100. Also, it gave Swift her twenty-first Top 40 on that chart. For the chart week of January 9, 2010, the song became Boys Like Girls' first Top 20 single on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming their biggest to date, and Swift's eleventh Top 20 single.\n\nA music video for the song was made, however, Swift does not appear in the video.

It is also the group's biggest hit to date.\n\nLove Drunk is the second studio album recorded by rock/pop band Boys Like Girls.\n\nThe album was recorded half in New York City and Vancouver because there are &quot;two different producers/production teams, two different environments, and two different styles of inspiration&quot;, stated by the band's frontman, Martin Johnson.\n\nBoys Like Girls is an American Pop rock band from Boston, Massachusetts, who gained mainstream recognition when they released their self-titled debut album Boys Like Girls.
