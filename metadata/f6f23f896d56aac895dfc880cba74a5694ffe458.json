And with good reason -- at 99 minutes in length, it features the perfect blend of songs, interviews, and interesting non-music clips from the early '60s, up until Keith Moon's untimely death in 1978. But what really holds the viewer's interest for the duration are the band's continuously fiery performances -- The Who was long-considered &quot;the world's greatest live act&quot; for good reason. The opening out-of-control clip, &quot;My Generation&quot; from The Smothers Brothers TV show, was shocking stuff for the time (the mid-'60s), while live takes of &quot;Baba O'Riley&quot; and &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot; from Shepperton Film Studios in '78 are among the finest and most energetic live rock performances ever captured on tape. Also included is footage of the band's show-stopping set at Woodstock (&quot;Sparks,&quot; &quot;Pinball Wizard,&quot; &quot;See Me, Feel Me&quot;), early European TV appearances (&quot;Magic Bus,&quot; &quot;Pictures of Lily&quot;), &quot;A Quick One&quot; from The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus, and a hilarious early-'70s band interview where Keith Moon and Pete Townshend trade witty banter. The Kids Are Alright is a thoroughly entertaining must-see for fans of The Who and rock &amp; rollers everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 1. My Generation\r\n 2. I Can't Explain\r\n 3.
