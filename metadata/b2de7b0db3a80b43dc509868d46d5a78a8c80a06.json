The seas and oceans, whose total area covers 72 % of our planet, are invaluable but not inexhaustible resource : too often imbalances originating from a human initiative jeopardize their fragile ecosystem.\nAwareness and publicize the importance of protecting marine heritage , this is the ambition of Yann Arthus -Bertrand .\nEssential to the lives of many people around the globe resource, yet the sea is under increasing pollution. Effect &quot; trash &quot; , overfishing , wild coastal urbanization are phenomena that threaten water quality and, in fact , wildlife and marine flora . It is therefore necessary to know the specific circumstances for better control and prevent aggravation of existing emergencies .\nYann Arthus -Bertrand invites us to an extraordinary journey with the discovery of remarkable sites around the globe .

Why ?\nThis is what we find throughout this program from the United States , one of the most industrialized countries of the world. A country where we begin to realize , despite official indifference , the fragility of the Earth and its space among the largest and most beautiful .\nWe are more numerous on the planet. And this we can not do much about it . But , to transport us , to warm us , to cultivate the land , to feed us , to manage our waste , we need a new contract with nature ! And it depends on each of us. Some refuse to resign .\nYann Arthus -Bertrand therefore takes us to the discovery of men and women across the world. They are the pioneers of this new relationship with nature . In Peru, for example, the Amazon rainforest disappears. A French Helen Collongues , fights to save mankind and animals that inhabit it. In Florida, a unique wetland in the world, is in danger : the Everglades are invaded by man: its roads, houses, factories.\nBut the Americans have launched a massive program to restore this ecological treasure. China also believes the planet . It is innovative in the field of renewable energies. For heating , cooking , part of the population simply recycles its feces. As for Haiti , he lost almost all its forests. Fortunately, a man refuses fate : Jean- Baptiste Chavannes tried to save his country from deforestation .\nFinally, you will discover the &quot; good home &quot; , the pavilion was built especially for the show. Good home saves 85% energy compared to a conventional dwelling.\n\n8)  The earth does not belong to man man belongs to earth Part 2 \nPart 2 of &quot;The earth does not belong to man man belongs to earth&quot;\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img836.imageshack.us/img836/4111/76gw.jpg&quot;
