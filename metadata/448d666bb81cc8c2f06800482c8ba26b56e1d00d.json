Both audio and video sources are lossy sourced, and very likely a higher quality version will surface soon.  (And the inevitable commercial DVD will be top quality, and should be purchased by everyone reading or writing this text file.)  This is simply my attempt to take the best audio/video sources I could find on the Internets the weekend of the show, and make an NTSC DVD that would play on my TV.  The resulting DVD turned out quite nice, so I share it here so that others may benefit from my afternoon of format conversion and audio tweaking.\n\nThat said, the results are quite good.  This looks and sounds quite a bit better than the &quot;highest quality&quot; recording I Tivo'ed off cable, and unlike the US broadcasts, it's complete.  Yeah, I'd much rather have something encoded from a high bitrade satellite feed rather than XviD.  But that hasn't surfaced yet, and I'm sure there are others out there who, in the meantime, would like to enjoy this on DVD.\n\nCONVERSIONS INFO:\nVIDEO:  XviD video (576x320, 25fps, 2184Kbps) converted to MPEG2 (CBR 8500Kbps 720x480 29.97fps) using TMPGEnc 2.524.\nAUDIO1:  Original XviD video (48KHz 224Kbps MP3 audio) converted to 48KHz stereo WAV and normalized using Adobe Audition 1.5.\nAUDIO2:  FLACs extracted to 44.1KHz stereo and joined using SHNTool.

When the commercial product becomes available, buy it.  And while you're at it, END GLOBAL POVERTY.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:448d666bb81cc8c2f06800482c8ba26b56e1d00d","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+at+Live+8+-+NTSC+16%3A9+DVD+from+Nokia+Dbox+XviD+source","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"448d666bb81cc8c2f06800482c8ba26b56e1d00d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,141,102,107,184,28,200,194,240,104,0,72,44,139,162,107,86,225,208,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
