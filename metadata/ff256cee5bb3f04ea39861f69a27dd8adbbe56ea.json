The sound is the result of 10 grueling years on the road, reflected in the amazing slide guitar of Rachelle van Zanten, the songwriting smarts of Daisy Blue Groff, and Kim GrybaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s extensive experience behind the drum kit.\n\n\nTheir second album, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFortissimoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, was self-released in 2000. The group toured Iceland, Holland, Germany and the US following its release. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFortissimoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was nominated for 4 Prairie Music Awards, and Painting Daisies walked away with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEntertainers of the YearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ beating out Nickelback, Jann Arden and Wide Mouth Mason.\n\n\nHaving gotten together in early 1995 as an acoustical duo between Rachelle van Zanten (guitar/vocals) and Daisy Blue Groff (guitar/vocals), Painting Daisies didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t officially take off until Carolyn Fortowsky (bass) and Kim Gryba (drums) were eventually recruited.\n\n\nThe bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first album, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFlambescenceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, debuted in 1998 following 3 cross-country tours of their native Canada. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFlambescenceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ won an ARIA award for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbest new folk recordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\n\nAfter another extensive tour of Europe and the US, the band won CBCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGreat Canadian Music DreamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Competing against 4,000 acts across Canada, the ladies won their own TV show with guest Randy Bachman (The Guess Who/BTO) that was nominated for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBest TV SpecialÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ at the Gemini Awards.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlambescense 1997\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nUptown Local\nGlamourized\nA Song For Jeremy\nThe Swinger's Guide To Self Improvement\nFor The Boys\nJust A Theory\nThe God Song\nI'm So Lame\nHow I'm Supposed To Be\nPositive Blue Funk\nHunting\nMike Stipe The Shining Light\nBlack Berets And Mochaccino\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFortissimo 2000\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nCarpal Tunnel\nRescue\nThe Church of Cosmetology\nRunaway Lane\nIf Need Be\nIt's The Thought\nSerpentine Diatribe\nEat Your Words\nBeale Street\nWalking Home Lately\nSheep\nGarbage Heap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely Live \n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nThe Church of Cosemetology\nDon't Leave Me Here\nKhartouche\nDeep\nIntroductions\nThe Tiki Room\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhonography 2005 \n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nBe There Too\nArnhem\nDon't Leave Me Here\nC'Mon\nKharteuche\nOnly Love Matters\nPeace, love, Understanding\nThe Tiki Room\nIn New York\nP.T.
