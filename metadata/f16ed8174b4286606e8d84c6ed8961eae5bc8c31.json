At the age of 30, John Nash, a stunningly original and famously eccentric MIT mathematician, suddenly began claiming that aliens were communicating with him and that he was a special messenger. Diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, Nash spent the next three decades in and out of mental hospitals, all but forgotten. During that time, a proof he had written at the age of 20 became a foundation of modern economic theory. In 1994, as Nash began to show signs of emerging from his delusions, he was awarded a Nobel Prize in Economics. The program features interviews with John Nash, his wife Alicia, his friends and colleagues, and experts in game theory and mental illness.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f16ed8174b4286606e8d84c6ed8961eae5bc8c31","amp;dn":"The+American+Experience+-+A+Brilliant+Madness+%282002+Documentary%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f16ed8174b4286606e8d84c6ed8961eae5bc8c31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,110,216,23,75,66,134,96,110,141,132,198,237,137,97,234,229,188,140,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
