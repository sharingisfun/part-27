Its aim is to show the essential connection between the thought of the medieval schools of philosophy and that of the Greek philosophers, as it was mediated to the medieval world by the Neoplatonists, St Augustine, and the Arabian and Jewish thinkers of the early Middle Ages.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac1c4b704efd9510631cb4f7fcd5961176ae2548","amp;dn":"David+Knowles+-+The+Evolution+of+Medieval+Thought+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac1c4b704efd9510631cb4f7fcd5961176ae2548","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,28,75,112,78,253,149,16,99,28,180,247,252,213,150,17,118,174,37,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
