H. Lawrence. It follows three generations of the Brangwen family living in Nottinghamshire, particularly focusing on the sexual dynamics of, and relations between, the characters.\n\nLawrence's frank treatment of sexual desire and the power it plays within relationships as a natural and even spiritual force of life, though perhaps tame by modern standards, caused The Rainbow to be prosecuted in an obscenity trial in late 1915, as a result of which all copies were seized and burnt. After this ban it was unavailable in Britain for 11 years, although editions were available in the USA.\nIn 1988, the BBC produced a television adaptation by Anne Devlin, directed by Stuart Burge with Imogen Stubbs in the role of Ursula Brangwen.\n\nCast\n\nImogen Stubbs ...
