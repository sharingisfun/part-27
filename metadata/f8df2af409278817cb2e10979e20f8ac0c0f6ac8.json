Odd object training Ã¢â‚¬â€œ generally -  involves exercise using heavy 'found objects' or implements that you can modify for strength training. Many odd objects such as Atlas stones have been traditionally used as part of strongman training. This type of exercise is nothing new, but it has been coming back into favor recently. An odd object is a non-rigid implement with a center of mass that is not fixed. In conventional strength training, the pattern of movement is fixed, whereas the load given by odd objects will cause adjustments during the movement. Some label this style of training 'real world training', and odd objects certainly have benefits, including versatility, portability, and simplicity. The only limit is your own creativity, as well!
