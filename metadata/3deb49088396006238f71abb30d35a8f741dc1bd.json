I've got a lot of requests to encode my own version of this, despite the fact that at one time, there were already 3 versions of this film on TPB.\n\n***There are TWO audio tracks, SWEDISH or ENGLISH COMMENTARY ;)***\n\nOptional external ENGLISH subs in VOBsub format.\n\n----\n\nMini Plot:\n\nThis Ingmar Bergman film explores the disillusionment of an elderly physician, Professor Isak Borg, as he reflects upon his life and begins to perceive his mortality. As he travels to Lund to receive an honorary award after 50 years of medical practice, he finds himself repeatedly affected by intrusive dreams and hallucinations that expose his darkest fears. He slowly comes to realize that the choices he made in the past have created a cold and empty life, devoid of real meaning or value. Finally, he achieves redemption and reintegration through forgiveness and the love of his family.\n\n----\n\nEncoded by: sickboy88\nCodec: XviD 1.1.0 Beta 2\nBitrate: 925 kb/s AVG\nAspect: 640x496 = 1.29:1\nAudio 1: Swedish, 60 kb/s VBR AVG MONO @ 48K Hz\nAudio 2: English Commentary, 60 kb/s VBR AVG MONO @ 48K Hz\nSubtitles: External VOBsub: English\nRuntime: 01:31:53\nFPS: 23.976\n\n----\n\nIf you are going to watch this, you'll want to install the NEW XviD codec:\n\nNow at Beta 2!\n\nhttp://www.koepi.org/XviD-1.1.0-Beta2-04042005.exe\n\nFor top quality, make sure you use the XviD decoder configerator, and turn\non (Y) and (UV) deblocking, and the new feature of\nXviD 1.1.0 (Y) and (UV) DERINGING.\n\nIf you have a slow computer, please turn off pre-processing.
