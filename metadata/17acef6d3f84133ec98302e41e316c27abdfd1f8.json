Yet the story of feeding the world\nbegins in a garden. The first farmers were hunterÃ¢â‚¬â€œgatherers who started\nby growing food around their temporary dwellings. These days few of us\ngrow food for a living, but most of us have grown food in a garden or\nknow somebody who does.\nTalk about feeding the world invokes numbers that are hard to conceptu-\nalise Ã¢â‚¬â€œ hundreds of millions of people, thousands of tonnes of food and\ngigalitres of water. But the garden is a scale we can comprehend, and\nthroughout this book the garden is the lens through which we will explore\nhow the world feeds itself.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17acef6d3f84133ec98302e41e316c27abdfd1f8","amp;dn":"Out+Of+The+Scientist%27s+Garden+%28PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17acef6d3f84133ec98302e41e316c27abdfd1f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,172,239,109,63,132,19,62,201,131,2,228,30,49,108,39,171,223,209,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
