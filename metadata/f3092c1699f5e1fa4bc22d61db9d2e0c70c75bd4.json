Silvestri would begin performing both the plotting and pencilling chores, but the series was subsequently drawn by other artists, including David Finch. The title was originally published through Homage Studios, a studio Silvestri shared with Jim Lee, as a 4 part mini-series (Volume 1, 1992Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1993). Soon afterwards, Silvestri formed Top Cow Productions and Cyberforce received a regular monthly series (Volume 2, 35 issues, 1993Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1997), the first few issues crossing over with WildC.A.T.s for the &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; story. Since then, Cyberforce has been published by Top Cow.\n\nThe comic-book focused upon a team of mutants who had all at one point been captured by Cyberdata, an enormous corporation with ambitions of world-takeover. Cyberdata was run by brilliant scientists who had created advanced cybernetics technology and had employed this technology to create &quot;Special Hazardous Operations Cyborg&quot; or S.H.O.C.s. The captured mutants were all used in the experiments that had led to the creation of the S.H.O.C.s, and had had their mutant abilities enhanced with cybernetic implants. The mutants escaped and banded together as Cyberforce to put an end to Cyberdata's plans.\n\nCyberforce v3 #0-6 (2006): &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7806867/Cyberforce__0-6_(2006)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7806867/Cyberforce__0-6_(2006)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCyberforce - Hunter-Killer #1-5 (2009-2010) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7806806/Cyberforce__Hunter_Killer__1-5_(2009-2010)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7806806/Cyberforce__Hunter_Killer__1-5_(2009-2010)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCyberforce v4 #1 (2012) (Ongoing) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7736544/Cyber_Force_001&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7736544/Cyber_Force_001&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3092c1699f5e1fa4bc22d61db9d2e0c70c75bd4","amp;dn":"Cyberforce+v1+%230-4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3092c1699f5e1fa4bc22d61db9d2e0c70c75bd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,9,44,22,153,245,225,250,75,194,45,97,219,157,46,12,112,199,91,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
