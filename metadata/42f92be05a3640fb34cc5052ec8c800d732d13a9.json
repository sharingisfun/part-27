Written by its two comic leads, Cumming and Masson, The High Life delights viewers with its mix of Scottish sensibility and camp outrageousness.\n\nThe High Life revolves around the lives and loves of flight attendants who work for fictitious Scottish airline Air Scotia. Cumming (Sebastian Flight) and Masson (Steve McCracken) demonstrate perfect comic timing, while Redmond (Shona Spurtle) proves adept as the antagonist who always wants to show Sebastian up as a narcissistic egocentric. Ryecart (Captain Hilary Duff) is hilarious as the absentminded captain, who, despite never being 'all there', has control of the plane!\n\nThe Scottish accent is, at times, a bit hard to follow, but is funny nonetheless. Versatile Scot Cumming, who has done a few accents in his career: a Russian accent in Golden Eye; an American accent in Romy and Michele's High School Reunion; has a ball spouting all the lines in his native tongue! And speaking of accents, I think this must be the only sitcom to ever include the F-word. In one episode, Steve asks Sebastian: &quot;You for coffee?&quot;, but with a Scottish accent it sounds very similar to: &quot;You F*** off, eh?&quot;\n\nIt's a shame this comedy gem ran for only six episodes but the call to Holly wood was too strong for Cummings, who knows what other story lines Cumming and Masson may have come up with.....\n\nA MUST SEE! \nAuthor: skottyrock ( taken from a review on the IMDb )\n\nThis is a camptastic piece of comedy craft, Enjoy :)\n\nSeason 1, Episode 0: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œComic AsidesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ - Pilot\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½9 January 1994 \n\nto get the real feel of the show skip to Episode 1\n\n________________________________________\n\nSeason 1, Episode 1: Feart\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½6 January 1995\n\nSteve and Sebastian decide to find a way out of short-haul flights.
