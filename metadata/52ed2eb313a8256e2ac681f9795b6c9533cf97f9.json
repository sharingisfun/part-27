This is a great series of picture-books put together by Alex Ross and Paul Dini. The writing is good, but Ross' artwork is the real deal here. Simply stunning! And even better in physical oversized copies... if you enjoy this torrent, buy the comic! It's stunning and a great treasure trove to have.
