Just enable their filtering in Adguard settings","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d8133745a194efbd448254d3d5b77f7035933a3","amp;dn":"Adguard+5.10+Full+%2B+Serial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d8133745a194efbd448254d3d5b77f7035933a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,129,51,116,90,25,78,251,212,72,37,77,61,91,119,247,3,89,51,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
