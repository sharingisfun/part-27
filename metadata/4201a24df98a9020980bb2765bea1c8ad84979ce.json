Here are four other good records from the best decade of music. Paris Black and Taxxi are more obscure than the other two and ultra rare to grab. They will surely be a great listening experience for those who like synthpop (Paris Black) and new wave/Rock (Taxxi). I love the track &quot;I'm No Angel&quot;. Taxxi should have been/could have been big, but I assume it was not meant to be either! finally you know what to do after downloading....seed people!\n\nFreiheit - Fantasy [1988]\n\nTracklisting:\n\n1   Keeping The Dream Alive (Single Version) (4:09) \n2   Kissed You In The Rain (3:45) \n3   Diana (4:14) \n4   The Land Of Fantasy (4:51) \n5   Moonlight (3:10) \n6   Tears Are A Girl's Best Friend (5:01) \n7   So Good (4:04) \n8   Forever And A Day (3:18) \n9   Poor Little Boy (3:23) \n10   On The Run To Be Free (4:08) \n11   Keeping The Dream Alive (Extended Version) (6:33) \n\n\nMummy Calls - Mummy Calls  [1986]\n\nTracklisting:\n\nA1   Kiss Me (4:02) \nA2   Sexual Desire (4:01) \nA3   We Will (4:02) \nA4   Let's Go (5:46) \nA5   Beauty Has Her Way (3:57) \nB1   Deadly Night (4:45) \nB2   Chestnut Tree (4:21) \nB3   In The Darkness (4:41) \nB4   Message On My Door (4:03) \nB5   Jane I'll Kiss You In The Desert (4:35) \n\n\nParis Black - Secret Seduction [1989]\n\nTracklisting:\n\n1   Better Get Ready\n2   Buried Alive\n3   Black &amp; White\n4   What's Come Over You\n5   Why Me\n6   Two Worlds\n7   So You Fall For it All\n8   Barely\n9   Lover\n10  Every Emotion\n11  The Rising Line\n\n\nTaxxi - ExposÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© [1985]\n\nTracklisting:\n\nA1 Still in Love 3:09 \nA2 Losing Her 3:34 \nA3 Who Knows Me 3:07 \nA4 Russian Roulette 3:43 \nA5 Lipstick 3:49 \nB1 Forever 3:51 \nB2 The Real Thing 3:00 \nB3 Guessing Games 3:37 \nB4 I'm No Angel 3:03 \nB5 Double Edged Blade 3:12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4201a24df98a9020980bb2765bea1c8ad84979ce","amp;dn":"4+Rare+80s+Albums+%5BPart+66%5D+Rock%2C+Pop-Rock%2C+New+Wave-Rock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4201a24df98a9020980bb2765bea1c8ad84979ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,1,162,77,249,138,144,32,152,11,178,118,91,234,28,138,216,73,121,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
