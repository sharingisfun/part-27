This version had a great groove and really helped cement this tune in the rotation.  The instrumental &quot;Bag End&quot; allowed the whole band to stretch out, and Leslie West added his heavy rock vibe to &quot;Crossroads&quot; and &quot;Going Down.&quot;\n\nGregg was really at his best to begin the second half, singing his heart out on &quot;Melissa&quot; before ripping a bluesy version of &quot;Come On In My Kitchen&quot; with guest guitarist John Kadlecik of Furthur.  &quot;Maydell&quot; segued flawlessly into the Jimi Hendrix tune &quot;Manic Depression,&quot; which rocked the house!  That powerful 3/4 groove sounds so good with the big ABB sound behind it.\n\n&quot;No One To Run With&quot; was jammy and inspired, and a host of guests, including Jay Collins and Scott Sharrard from Gregg Allman's band, contributed to a massive groove on &quot;That's What Love Will Make You Do.&quot;  Derek really went for it on &quot;Mountain Jam,&quot; displaying some of his best playing of the whole run.  He was in Skydog territory, totally in the zone and hittin' the note! \n\nAn exciting, guest-stacked &quot;Southbound&quot; encore finished the show with a bang, but not until after midnight! \n\nDisc One\n\n1.
