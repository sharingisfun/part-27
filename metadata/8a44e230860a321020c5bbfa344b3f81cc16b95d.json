Titus, Matt, and Jim, who prefer to go by first names only, met in Alabama but later relocated to Atlanta. After several months of jam sessions, All the Saints hit upon a sound they described as &quot;70s psychedelia and classic dark riffs.&quot; Intense live shows led to a passionate regional fan base and critical acclaim. In 2007, All the Saints began working on an EP with Billy Bennett, the engineer who had recorded the Whigs' debut album.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a44e230860a321020c5bbfa344b3f81cc16b95d","amp;dn":"All+The+Saints+-+Intro+to+Fractions+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a44e230860a321020c5bbfa344b3f81cc16b95d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,68,226,48,134,10,50,16,32,197,187,250,52,75,63,129,204,22,185,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
