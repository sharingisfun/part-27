She canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t imagine a future without children, but her partner doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem to feel the same way, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not sure whether she could go it alone. Meanwhile, up in Yorkshire, Cath is longing to start a family with her husband, Rich. No one would be happier to have a child than Rich, but Cath is infertile. Could these strangers help one another out? Combining Sarah RaynerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deft exploration of raw emotions with the joy and resilience of friendship, The Two Week Wait is a memorable, moving page-turner about two very different women, each yearning to create a family of her own.\n\n\nThis is a multi-tracker torrent.
