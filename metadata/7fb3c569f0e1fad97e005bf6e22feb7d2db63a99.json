And then, like clockwork, the event is invariably followed by a plague of black rats that spring from nowhere to spread destruction and famine in their wake. For the first time on film, NOVA and National Geographic capture this massive rat population explosion in the kind of vivid detail not possible in 1959, when the last invasion occurred.\n\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 524 MiB for 56mn 2s 262ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : HDTV\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 182 Kbps\nAspect            : 560 x 320 (1.750) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 112 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fb3c569f0e1fad97e005bf6e22feb7d2db63a99","amp;dn":"Rat+Attack-PBS+Nova+2-24-2009%5BHDTV%5D%7EEkolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fb3c569f0e1fad97e005bf6e22feb7d2db63a99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,179,197,105,240,225,250,217,126,0,91,246,226,47,235,125,45,182,58,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
