Skilled\r\n Tau admirals can eliminate the bulk of an enemy fleet before they can\r\n even get within boarding distance. The Tau have access to a wide array\r\n of upgrades and traits to improve their Torpedoes and Ordnances even\r\n further.                                                                \r\n                                                                         \r\n This DLC allows you to play as the Tau Empire fleet, featuring all-new\r\n ships, castes and gameplay mechanics, as well as the unique Warfare\r\n system.                                                                 \r\n                                                                         \r\n                                                                         \r\n   NOTE:                                                               \r\n                                                                         \r\n This is made standalone, featuring all currently released DLC and fully \r\n updated!                                                                \r\n\r\n    INSTALL NOTES\r\n\r\n 1.
