Jobim's new sound adapted the rhythmic variety and percussive excitement of the samba to the intimacy of syncopated guitar, while echoing the melodies and harmonies of cool jazz.\nComposer of such standards as Girl From Ipanema, One Note Samba, Wave and Dindi, Jobim was inducted into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame in 1991.\nV.I.E.W. Video presents an extraordinary gathering of jazz giants in this enhanced DVD presentation with many bonus features. Along with Jobim himself (in his last recorded concert appearance), these superstars recreate Jobim's classic melodies in a beautiful concert-length &quot;Thank You.&quot;\n\n\nProgram:\n\n1.
