Leslie Nielsen plays the commander who brings his spacecruiser crew to Planet Altair-4, home to Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon), his daughter (Anne Francis), a dutiful robot named RobbyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and to a mysterious terror. Featuring sets of extraordinary scale and the first all-electronic musical soundscape in film history, Forbidden Planet is in a movie orbit all its own.\n\nOne of the most important films in the science-fiction genre, Forbidden Planet still continues to enthral audiences with its combination of groundbreaking special effects, sophisticated storyline and sheer visual power. This was the Star Wars of its day, arguably the finest sci-fi film of the 1950s and a film that would exert an enormous influence over sci-fi, both in cinema and on television, for over two decades. One of the first films to take science-fiction seriously, Forbidden Planet set a high benchmark for subsequent films in the genre and it still remains one of the best-loved, most highly regarded films of its kind.\n\nIt was the phenomenal success of Universal's sci-fi films in the early 1950s that motivated MGM, a company renowned for blockbuster visual extravaganzas (usually in the musical field), to make a genre-defining spectacular which no other studio could match. The studio succeeded, far beyond its wildest dreams. Most of the lavish million dollar plus budget went on large-scale sets and extraordinarily detailed props, which really did offer a convincing vision of an alien civilisation on a far distant world. The piÃƒÂ¨ce de rÃƒÂ©sistance was Robby the Robot, now one of the most recognisable icons of the sci-fi genre and an obvious forerunner of cinema's other mechanical marvels, notably the droids in Star Wars. So popular was Robby that he/it immediately reappeared in the film The Invisible Boy (1957) and then in countless American TV shows, including The Thin Man, The Twilight Zone, Lost In Space, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and Mork &amp; Mindy. A marvel of design, Robby is the star of this film (not that there is much competition); the only member of the cast who is not out-classed and out-staged by him/it is Walter Pidgeon, who makes a subtly menacing villain, a far cry from the manic mad scientist of the early sci-fi films.\n\nThe influence of Forbidden Planet on the sci-fi genre cannot be exaggerated. Producer Gene Roddenberry was inspired to create a television series based on this film - that series became Star Trek, arguably the most successful series of the genre. Irwin Allen's Lost In Space was also heavily influenced by the film, borrowing the design of the spaceship, the robot, and even the sets. Star Wars includes several obvious nods to the film (note the similarity of the Krell City to the interior of the Death Star). In fact, it is quite hard to find a sci-fi film that has not, in some way, been influenced by it. Forbidden Planet is a masterpiece of its genre, a rare example of a sci-film that is crafted with flair and intelligence, and with a budget to make it work. Miraculously, the film has barely dated since the day it first captivated cinema audiences and transported them - to an amazing brave new world of the imagination.\n\nThere's a reason this film is called the granddaddy of all science fiction.\n\nExtras:Amazing.mp4, Original Trailer.mp4, Robby The Robot.mp4 and Watch The Skies.m4v\n(Watch The Skies needs the file extension changing from m4v to mp4)\n\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 5.90gb\nDuration.... 01:28:30\nCodec.... h264\nh264 (main @L4.0)\nChapters...
