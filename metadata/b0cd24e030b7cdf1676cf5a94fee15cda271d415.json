Bullinger is very concise in his Biblical interpretations of constellations and star names. His book is very informative as to where the constellation pictures came fromÃ¢â‚¬â€a masterpiece that brings ancient light to a new generation. In addition to teaching the constellations, BullingerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book gives insights that build faith in God. The fact that most of the stars ancient names can be found and were used in the Bible to convey messages in one word adds even more credence to the truth of GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Word and that fact that God is still in control. The Ã¢â‚¬Å“witness of the starsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as explained in this book may well be a fulfillment of that passage in Romans 16 where Paul states that God has revealed the gospel to all nations. For centuries, men have looked to the stars for navigation and signs for successful farming. By showing the Biblical symbolism of the constellations, Bullinger, a respected Bible scholar, shows how the stars are also GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blackboard in the sky. Readers who desire untouched evidence of God will find it in this historical account in the stars from ancient civilizations on the message God sent back then to us. Ã¢â‚¬Å“He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Psalms 147:4) The stars reveal GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s glory, His power, and His truth.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0cd24e030b7cdf1676cf5a94fee15cda271d415","amp;dn":"The+Witness+of+the+Stars.+++++++By+E.+W.+Bullinger","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0cd24e030b7cdf1676cf5a94fee15cda271d415","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,205,36,224,48,183,205,241,103,108,245,169,79,238,21,205,162,113,212,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
