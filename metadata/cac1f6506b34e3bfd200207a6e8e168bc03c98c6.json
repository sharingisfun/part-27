MICHEL T. KLARE. &quot;BLOOD AND OIL,&quot; joins the ranks of these two heroes.\n\nNEO, BE CAREFUL WHICH OF THE TWO PILLS YOU TAKE. YOU CAN&amp;#039;T GO BACK.\n\nThe world&amp;#039;s rapidly growing economy is dependent on oil, the supply is running out and the U.S. and other great powers are engaged in an escalating game of brinkmanship to secure its continued free flow. Such is the premise of Klare&amp;#039;s powerful and brilliant new book (following Resource Wars). The U.S.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½with less than 5% of the world&amp;#039;s total populationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½consumes about 25% of the world&amp;#039;s total supply of oil, he argues. With no meaningful conservation being attempted, Klare sees the nation&amp;#039;s energy behavior dominated by four key trends: &quot;an increasing need for imported oil; a pronounced shift toward unstable and unfriendly suppliers in dangerous parts of the world; a greater risk of anti-American or civil violence; and increased competition for what will likely be a diminishing supply pool.&quot; In clear, lucid prose, Klare lays out a disheartening and damning indictment of U.S. foreign policy. From the waning days of WWII, when Franklin Roosevelt gave legitimacy to the autocratic Saudi royalty, to the current conflict in Iraq, Klare painstakingly describes a nation controlled by its unquenchable thirst for oil. Rather than setting out a strategy for energy independence, he finds a roadmap for further U.S. dependence on imported oil, more exposure for the U.S. military overseas and, as a result, less safety for Americans at home and abroad. While Klare offers some positive suggestions for solving the problem, in tone and detail this work sounds a dire warning about the future of the world.
