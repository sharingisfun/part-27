I enjoy giving a mark, touching, palping, reviewing the past, making comments, making the music live, arguing about something, etc ;\n2. I think nobody did it before on torrents; \n3. The most important one. I have (as a metal fan, you too) the habit of listening to music, from track one to the last one. I listen to an album an not a track exclusively. But for my mp3 player, I decided to change my way of listening to music, and to make hard-rock listening more like pop listening, or radio listening : that is the band is constantly changing, which we call zapping listening... Of course, you can tell me that from 60 Gbs of music, I simply can put shuffle on everything and letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rock baby... But I wanted something cleverly arranged, so I still had to make a choice... and came the idea of doing the METAL TOP 1000. \n\nConcerning the numerotation (or order)of the tracks. Of course, you understand that nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â°x is not in particular better than nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â°x+1. I just placed 1000 tracks into ten ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpacksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of a hundred that I thought convenient, and then I rearenged it. For that one, I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t tell that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAngelsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from Within temptation is a better track than ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUnadultered HatredÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from Dying Fetus or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe Gates of DeliriumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from Yes. It just seemed to me that these 3 tracks sould be ranged from 601 to 700, and in that pack I choose ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAngelsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ because ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ as I told before ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ WT is a huge seller. That track from DF is A perfect KILLER, so nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â°602. The Special Defects album should be considered a masterpiece, so i put it nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â°603. The Planet X album, and that track is a perfect instrumental yet very rythmic piece, so i put it nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â°604. Another Metallica... That I canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t place after the top 5 of each list, specially this one. \nIf you tell me then that the Mars Volta track is better (musically speaking, and genre-representatively speaking) than the Sleep Terror (do you know that band ? no ? Okay, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re here for that...) youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d be right... Except that The Mars Volta have 3 or 4 tracks on the top and far above... If you tell me you prefer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShy BoyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of Lee Roth than ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAngelsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and that track should deserve first place, well... YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d probably right... \n\nI recall that I made it taking into account my preferences (that youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll easily see more precisely  in the first four list, i.e. from 1 (guess who ? guess who are the first 10 ?) to 400, and whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the most representative in the metal scene today AND that is not shitty. \n\nConcerning that part. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s maximum 3 or 4 tracks that I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really like, or like just so-so. It begins to be the best among the better. Big Bands are coming. \n\nFeel free to discuss. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2eb83470c01f04cb9287bc8baa11310ad9e2724e","amp;dn":"METAL+TOP+1000+PART+601-700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2eb83470c01f04cb9287bc8baa11310ad9e2724e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,184,52,112,192,31,4,203,146,135,188,139,170,17,49,10,217,226,114,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
