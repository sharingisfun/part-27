At the climax of their dispute they rip the family recipe book in half - one brother gets the starters and the other gets the main courses. They set up rival restaurants, across the road from each other, and spend the next twenty years trying to out-do each other. Neither brother will admit it but they both know they are not entirely successful in the 'other half' of the menu. It takes a daughter - a successful corporate lawyer marrying a man from a very different background - to reunite them. She is planning her marriage and is determined that they will both cook the wedding banquet.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://akas.imdb.com/title/tt2180423/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://akas.imdb.com/title/tt2180423/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e045dff43b28a5162acbe67626b759d6285f01c5","amp;dn":"Jadoo+Kings+of+Curry+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e045dff43b28a5162acbe67626b759d6285f01c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,69,223,244,59,40,165,22,42,203,230,118,38,183,89,214,40,95,1,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
