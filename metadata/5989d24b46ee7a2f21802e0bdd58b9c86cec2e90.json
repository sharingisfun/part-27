At its heart are the dramatic and violent events associated with the French Revolution of 1789 and the birth of the First Republic in 1792. For the next two centuries, writers in France struggled to make sense of these and subsequent events in French revolutionary history, producing a rich and perceptive analysis of the nature of republican government. But, as Revolution and the Republic shows, these important debates were not limited to the narrow confines of politics and to the writing of constitutions. Such was their significance that they occupied a central place in discussions about religion, science, philosophy, commerce, and the writing of history. They also shaped arguments about the character of France and the French nation as well as polemics about the role of intellectuals in French society. Moreover, they continue to be of importance in France today as the country faces the challenges posed by globalisation, multiculturalism, and the reform of the welfare state. Integrating the perspectives of intellectual history, political theory, social and cultural history, and political economy, Jeremy Jennings has written a study of political ideas that appeals to all those interested in the history of modern France and Europe more generally.\n\nReview\nAn impressive historiographical tour de force Biancamaria Fontana, Times Higher Education Jennings's scholarly achievement is considerable ... his narrative has Guizot's erudition, Tocqueville's eye for the paradoxes of French democracy, and Constant's concern for preserving individual liberty. Sudhir Hazareesingh, Times Literary Supplement This book represents an impressive achievement and has to be seen as one of the definitive accounts of the history of French political thought, Gavin Jacobson, French History This is a rich feast of a book: thoughtful, well informed, richly documented, imaginatively conceived, and full of fascinating ideas and insights [...] at once so lucid, so erudite, so elegantly shaped and so readable. Jonathan Beecher, The American Historical Review the first genuinely post-Jacobin - rather than pro- or anti-Jacobin - general history of French political thought [...] a major achievement. Eric Brandom, Journal of History and Cultures outstanding erudition and scope ... we should thank Jennings for rising to the challenge and reopening a much-needed debate about the roots of French political thought. Emile Chabal, Books &amp; Ideas an impressive treatment of the varieties of political, social, and cultural ideas that well serves all who teach French Studies. Derk Visser, French Review\n\nAbout the Author\nJeremy Jennings previously held posts at the universities of Swansea and Birmingham.
