First, the guy comes during Jeopardy, so I didn't get to record today's new episode, second, they tell me I dont get HD with the boxes they are providing and that the HD ones are $10/mth more. Then I learn (and this is the deal breaker) that my tv-tuner card in my computer cant change the channels anymore. So I've been researching an IR Blaster solution, but cant seem to find a feasible solution. I'm going to talk with them tomorrow, but I think cable is just not going to work...F**K COMCAST!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:283a5a8a6344bfd291131ad08b49fb0d38ea7ff6","amp;dn":"Jeopardy%21.S2014E97.Battle+of+the+Decades-+Finals%2C+Game+1.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"283a5a8a6344bfd291131ad08b49fb0d38ea7ff6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,58,90,138,99,68,191,210,145,19,26,208,139,73,251,13,56,234,127,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
