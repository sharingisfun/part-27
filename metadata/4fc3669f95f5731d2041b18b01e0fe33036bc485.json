Comics fans and fancy news blogs arent the only ones to take notice of Axe Cop - now the so-called real police know about him, too. And if theres one thing police dont like, its a guy with an axe whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s better than they are at catching and dispatching bad guys! Now Axe Cop and his partner Dinosaur Soldier are being treated like bad guys, not only by the police, but by the president and the army, too! But when a pair of nasty villains barge in from outer space and turn the army into actual bad guys, who gets the call to set things right?
