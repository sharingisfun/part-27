Frey formed the Eagles after he met drummer Don Henley in 1970 and the two eventually joined Linda Ronstadt's backup band for her summer tour. The Eagles formed in 1971 and released their debut album in 1972. Glenn Frey played guitar with the Eagles as well as piano and keyboards, and shared lead vocals with Don Henley. The Eagles broke up in 1980 after becoming one of the most successful bands of all time. Frey sang lead vocals on many Eagles hits such as &quot;Take It Easy&quot;, &quot;Peaceful Easy Feeling&quot;, &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot;, &quot;Already Gone&quot;, &quot;Lyin' Eyes&quot;, &quot;New Kid in Town&quot;, and &quot;Heartache Tonight&quot;. After the breakup of the Eagles in 1980, Frey embarked on a successful solo career. He released his debut album in 1982 and went on to record Top 40 hits &quot;The One You Love&quot;, &quot;Smuggler's Blues&quot;, &quot;Sexy Girl&quot;, &quot;The Heat Is On&quot;, and &quot;You Belong to the City&quot;. As a member of the Eagles, Frey has won six Grammys, and five American Music Awards. The Eagles have sold over 120 million albums worldwide and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998. As a solo artist and with the Eagles combined, Frey has released 24 Top 40 singles on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Allnighter is the second album by Glenn Frey, released in 1984 (see 1984 in music). It was the most successful album of his solo career, having reached #22 on the charts and releasing two Top 20 singles with &quot;Smuggler's Blues&quot; and &quot;Sexy Girl&quot;. The album was well received by most critics and helped Frey become a familiar face throughout the decade. The album reached gold status. The single &quot;Smuggler's Blues&quot; helped inspire the Miami Vice episode and Frey was invited to star in the episode. The music video for the single also won Frey an MTV Video Music Award in 1985.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f105c36c9a365f609c2b8faf79e762fa49c339a","amp;dn":"Glenn+Frey+-+The+Allnighter+%5B1984%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f105c36c9a365f609c2b8faf79e762fa49c339a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,16,92,54,201,163,101,246,9,194,184,250,247,158,118,47,164,156,51,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
