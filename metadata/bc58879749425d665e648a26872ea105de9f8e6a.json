However, even amongst this legendary brotherhood, the seeds of dissent had been sown long before the treacherous Warmaster Horus declared his grand heresy. \n\nABOUT THE BOOK\nGathered within this anthology are four novellas focusing on some of the mightiest warriors and leaders that mankind has ever known Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Fulgrim, Lion ElÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Jonson, Ferrus Manus and the twin primarchs Alpharius and Omegon Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the roles that they may have yet to play in a war which threatens to change the face of the Imperium forever.\n\nExtract: http://www.blacklibrary.com/Downloads/Product/PDF/p/the-primarchs.pdf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc58879749425d665e648a26872ea105de9f8e6a","amp;dn":"The+Primarchs+edited+by+Christian+Dunn+-+Horus+Heresy+-+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc58879749425d665e648a26872ea105de9f8e6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,88,135,151,73,66,93,102,94,100,138,38,135,46,161,5,222,159,142,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
