It finally\ncame out today [April 16], and let me tell you, it's well worth the wait.\n\nSheryl Crow is a prime example of something that gets better with age. And I'm not just\ntalking about her looks [although those ain't bad either...did you see her in Stuff?]. I'm also not\nsaying that her other albums weren't good, because they were more than that, but THIS\nalbum easily outdoes any of them. There are classic slap-your-knee vibes in songs like &quot;Soak\nUp The Sun&quot;, &quot;Diamond Road&quot; and &quot;Lucky Kid&quot;, as well as original and exhilarating rhythms\nas those found in &quot;Safe &amp; Sound&quot;, &quot;You're An Original&quot; and &quot;Hole In My Pocket&quot;.\n\nBut it's not only about the music on this album. Her lyrics and singing quality will keep you\ninterested as well. &quot;Over You&quot; is an interesting tune about drowning in love (if you will), while\nthe title track combines love yearning with love angst. &quot;It's So Easy&quot; is right up there with &quot;I\nJust Can't Stop Loving You&quot;, and &quot;Weather Channel&quot; is the kind of quirky yet cool tune you'd\nexpect her to end her album with.\n\nNot a single minute will be wasted on this album. It's rock, with a little bit of other flavors of\nmusic thrown in. What could be better?\n\n\n  \n  01 - Steve McQueen [S, Crow, John Shanks]      [03:26]\n  02 - Soak Up The Sun [S.
