While not as successful as their two previous records, it spawned the underground hit singles &quot;Legal Tender&quot; and &quot;Song for a Future Generation&quot;. It is also the only album to have all five original members of the band producing every song on an album. Originally intended to be mixed into two continuous tracks, like the previous Party Mix! album, Warner Brothers vetoed this decision in favour of the more traditional track order.\n\nThe track &quot;Don't Worry&quot; [not included in this torrent] is not a cover of any song by Yoko Ono. In fact, all the two songs have in common are the two-word &quot;lyrics&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a repetitively chanted &quot;Don't worry&quot;. It was removed from later pressings due to legal issues with Ono, who claimed the B-52's had not asked permission or paid her to cover her song. This is controversial; Ono's song, on the 1971 album Fly, is titled &quot;Don't Worry, Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking For Her Hand in the Snow)&quot; and is musically entirely different from the B-52's track. While the legal fact that she had been credited would suggest she was entitled to profit, The B-52's had credited Ono with songwriting on the track probably more out of tribute than seriousness. On subsequent pressings, the song was replaced with &quot;Legal Tender&quot;'s B-side, &quot;Moon 83&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a remake of their earlier track &quot;There's a Moon in the Sky (Called the Moon)&quot;.\n\nThe B-52's - Whammy! \n\nLabel: Island Masters \nCatalog#: 842 445-2 / IMCD 109 \nFormat: CD, Album, Reissue\nCountry: Germany \nReleased: 1983 \nGenre: Rock \nStyle: New Wave, Synth-pop \nCredits: Producer - Steven Stanley \nNotes: Original Sound Recording made by Island Records, Inc. \n\n\nTracklisting:\n\n1 Legal Tender (3:41) \n2 Whammy Kiss (5:21) \n3 Song For A Future Generation (3:58) \n4 Butterbean (4:16) \n5 Trism (3:24) \n6 Queen Of Las Vegas (4:35) \n7 Moon 83 (4:01) \n8 Big Bird (4:13) \n9 Work That Skirt (3:51) \n\n\nBy request....\n\nEnjoy and thanks for seeding !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d42cf3d44bee94c6ee4895f16d64cee19cfc8ebb","amp;dn":"The+B-52%5C%27s+%5B1983%5D+Whammy%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d42cf3d44bee94c6ee4895f16d64cee19cfc8ebb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,44,243,212,75,238,148,198,238,72,149,241,109,100,206,225,156,252,142,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
