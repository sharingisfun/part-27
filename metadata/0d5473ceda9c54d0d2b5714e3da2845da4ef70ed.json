She followed him to the same high school, joined the same committees, and even changed her outward personality to become the right match for Keishi. One day, looking for Keishi in the special section of the school, she runs into the school's trouble-maker Kirisaki Shin. As he begins to bully her, her true personality comes out: loud-mouthed and violent. To her dismay, Kirisaki decides that he likes that kind of girl. Lovey Dovey is the story of Saika's trials and tribulations in a love triangle at a school where &quot;Love is Prohibited.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d5473ceda9c54d0d2b5714e3da2845da4ef70ed","amp;dn":"Lovey+Dovey+%28Manga%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d5473ceda9c54d0d2b5714e3da2845da4ef70ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,84,115,206,218,156,84,208,210,181,113,78,61,162,132,93,164,239,112,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
