It is located in a barren landscape in South Dakota, and they initially regard the assignment as punishment. As they go about their assignments to retrieve missing Warehouse 13 artifacts and investigate reports of new ones, they come to understand the importance of what they are doing. They are enthusiastically joined by young, hip, brilliant techno-wiz Claudia Donovan.\n\n\nList of Episodes:\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=679525#pid679525&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=679525#pid679525&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFormat :\t\tXviD\nFile size:  \t\t350MiB avg. per episode\nDuration : \t\t42min avg. per episode\nWidth : \t\t624 pixels\nHeight : \t\t352 pixels\nAspect ratio :  \t16:9\nFrame rate :    \t23.976fps\nAudio: \t\t        MP3\nNr. of Files:\t\t12 + 2 Teaser + 1 txt =15\n\n\n                              ++++++++++++++++\nThis torrent is Missing the Christmas Special, which will air in December 2011.\nThe Special is considered E13 of the third season.\nThis is why there are only 12 episodes in this torrent.\n                              ++++++++++++++++\n\nAll files properly named, keeping the original file names intact.\nThis pack wouldn't have been possible without you, we worship you,\n\n+++eztv+++TvTeam+++VTV+++scenebalance+++TorrentDay+++eztv+++\n\nAfter 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.\n\n\n######################  You like your show in one pack?  ########################\n##############################  Here you go!  ###################################\nVISIT THE KABLAM!!! at SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:664b9125c0c7d4781ac888a2c5cd1574cfdc6d73","amp;dn":"Warehouse+13+-+Season+3+Complete+HDTV+%28XviD%2FMP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"664b9125c0c7d4781ac888a2c5cd1574cfdc6d73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,75,145,37,192,199,212,120,26,200,136,162,197,205,21,116,207,220,109,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
