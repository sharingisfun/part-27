It is implied that the title of the manga is derived from the &quot;good endings&quot; that are achieved in harem visual novels. Although the story was once concluded in the one shot version, the full version includes identical characters and settings.\n\nInfo Source: MyAnimeList\nDownload Source: Manga Traders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f3e1ba9bef58170024da9308e7896c499aef408","amp;dn":"GE%3A+Good+Ending+-+Vol.+08","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f3e1ba9bef58170024da9308e7896c499aef408","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,62,27,169,190,245,129,112,2,77,169,48,142,120,150,196,153,174,244,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
