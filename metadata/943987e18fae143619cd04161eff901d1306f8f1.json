Go through psychedelic portals, solve abstract puzzles, explore grand minimal forms or race against the stars. A science-fiction experience unlike any other game.\n\nTHE DESIGN\nA cinematic game with stunning movie-like graphics, each chapter is visually unique and explores an original concept with completely new game mechanics.\n\nTHE MUSIC\n40 minutes of original soundtrack to heighten your sense of wonder. The soundtrack features a variety of genres and has been tailored to every movement on the screen. Best experienced with headphones.\n\nTHE PHILOSOPHY\nLast Voyage is a game about space that is not about spaceships but rather what lies beyond our culture and technology. A game where you don't master a single task but rather explore a range of concepts. As a result, the levels are sometimes mysterious, and other times very direct. Sometimes completely still, and other times moving at the speed of light. While these chapters form a continuous narrative, you are constantly surprised with new ways to interact as you seamlessly transition from one chapter to another","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:943987e18fae143619cd04161eff901d1306f8f1","amp;dn":"Last+Voyage+v+1.0.5.ipa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"943987e18fae143619cd04161eff901d1306f8f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,57,135,225,143,174,20,54,25,205,4,22,30,255,144,29,19,6,248,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
