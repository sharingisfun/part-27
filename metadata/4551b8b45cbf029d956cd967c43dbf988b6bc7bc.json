Welcome to Dreamland focuses on the avant-garde, with brief forays into song structure. The poppiest must be Saboten (&quot;Low Chair&quot;), a quartet of young Tokyo women with a fragmented, naive approach to song construction and an art school bent in the lyrics. The group After Dinner, fronted by vocalist Haco, managed to swing a few Western releases with Recommended Records a year later. Their song &quot;The Room of Hair Mobiles&quot; is typical of their dreamy work. Luna Park Ensemble (not to be confused with the group Luna or Luna Park) strike a bizarre cabaret pose, while Sodaneva's muted, rhythmic guitar passages are sublime. Only Keiji Haino went on after this initial bit of exposure (and he had been around a long time before this anyway) to continually make recordings. Still, an intriguing snapshot of Tokyo and Osaka, and of Frith's taste in music.\n\nSource: Allmusic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4551b8b45cbf029d956cd967c43dbf988b6bc7bc","amp;dn":"Various+Artists+-+Wel+Dreamland+Another+Japan+%281986-MP3-VBR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4551b8b45cbf029d956cd967c43dbf988b6bc7bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,81,184,180,92,191,2,157,149,108,217,103,196,61,191,152,139,107,199,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
