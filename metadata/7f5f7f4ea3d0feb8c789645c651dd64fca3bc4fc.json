The preamplifier was a Cambridge 640P. Sound card, an ASUS XONAR Essence ST (Windows 7).\nRecorded using Audacity 1.3 Beta. Pops, Clicks, and Noise removed using iZotope Rx Advanced 2.01 software.\niZotope was easily the most important part of this process. Some of my vinyl is fifty years old. All were recorded using 32 bit float at 96 kHz sample rate, then ouputed to 32 bit 96 kHz WAV files, then edited with iZotope. The edited WAV files were then converted to 24-96 FLAC files and 320 bitrate mp3 at 48 kHz sample rate.\n\nThis is A Lot of work folks!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                 The Thelonious Monk Orchestra at Town Hall\n\n\nThis gig was the first time Charlie Rouse played with Monk, he continued for eleven years!\n\n\n\nThe Thelonious Monk Orchestra at Town Hall is an album by Thelonious Monk, originally released in 1959.
