Nichole and Mikey, two other kids, also run around with Zack and the gang.  Miss Bliss and Ms. Paladrino are the kids' teachers.\n\nThe show takes place at JFK in Indianapolis, Indiana.  The focus of the show is on Ms. Carrie Bliss, the history teacher.  Good Morning Miss Bliss does not take the form of the later show Saved by the Bell.  In fact, the only students that were in this show that go on to Saved by the Bell are Zack Morris, Lisa Turtle, Samuel 'Screech' Powers and Principal Richard Belding.  This show is of the life of Carrie Bliss' problems with Tina Palidrino, Milo and Richard Belding.\n\nThe season ran for 13 episodes on Disney.  The show then moved to NBC with the new name Saved by the Bell.\n\n(Good Morning Miss Bliss has an original &quot;Pilot&quot; episode, which aired on 7/11/1987; and starred Jonathan Brandis, Jaleel White and Brian Austin Green.  It is not included in this set.  You can see it on YT.)\n\n---------------------------\n\nThese were recorded from TV with a Standard Definition DVD recorder (from TV to recorder to DVD), so the video quality will be what it will be.\n\nFormat: mkv\n\n---------------------------\n\nSeason 1:\n\nEps 01 - Summer Love\t\t\t(11/30/88)\nEps 02 - Love Letters\t\t\t(12/07/88)\nEps 03 - Wall Street\t\t\t(12/14/88)\nEps 04 - Leaping to Conclusions\t\t(12/21/88)\nEps 05 - Parents and Teachers\t\t(12/28/88)\nEps 06 - The Showdown\t\t\t(01/04/89)\nEps 07 - Save the Last Dance for Me\t(02/04/89)\nEps 08 - The Boy Who Cried Rat\t\t(02/11/89)\nEps 09 - Let's Get Together\t\t(02/18/89)\nEps 10 - Practical Jokes\t\t(02/25/89)\nEps 11 - Stevie\t\t\t\t(03/04/89)\nEps 12 - Clubs and Cliques\t\t(03/11/89)\nEps 13 - The Mentor\t\t\t(03/18/89)\n\n\n**Don't hit and quit.
