A living Norman Rockwell painting, governed by the most basic values and free of all things considered undesirable by its founders. It was supposed to be paradise. And for a while, it was.\n\nOver the years, some in ElkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ridge have grown restless. They fear their refuge has become a prison . . . or a tomb. And they yearn to do the forbidden: escape. But when one desperate bid for freedom ends in a tragic accident, a heinous act of mob justice suddenly tears the idyllic mask from this promised land and the evil its residents sought to keep out blooms from within. Now, as a deadly chain reaction of events threatens the future of ElkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ridge, its elders gird for battle against the real world. And a group of terrified teens prepare to make their own standÃ¢â‚¬â€œagainst the people they once trusted and the only life theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever known. Because thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing left to do but fight or die.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d36ab1cecc4ba8dbb290072b613b28f68d29333","amp;dn":"Elk%27s+Run+%5BComplete%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d36ab1cecc4ba8dbb290072b613b28f68d29333","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,54,171,28,236,196,186,141,187,41,0,114,182,19,178,143,104,210,147,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
