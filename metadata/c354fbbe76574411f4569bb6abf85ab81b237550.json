It is a feminine form of Charles.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nSo, first of all: we love music. Our is core-based, but not metal-core at all.A little bit more melodic.\nJust try to mix some other genres e.g.: disco,pop,etc. and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll get issue. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s correct! \n\nWe also love hard things like breakdowns, screams. So, you can find your music-style in our music.
