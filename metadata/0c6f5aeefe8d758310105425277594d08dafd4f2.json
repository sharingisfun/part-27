When Barney steals Homer\\&amp;#039;s car and leaves it illegally parked between the Twin Towers, Homer and his family are forced to go to the Big Apple to\nretrieve it. Homer confesses that he has hated New York ever since a bad experience there as a young man, but Marge and the kids are excited to check the city out. Once there, Homer heads downtown to get the car while the others check out the sites. Homer finds that his car has been fitted with a boot by the police, who have also papered his windshield with piles of parking tickets. Enraged when he misses his chance to talk with the cop responsible for the boot, Homer drives off with the thing still stuck on his car, tearing up the pavement all along Broadway. Homer uses a pile driver to break the boot, but winds up breaking much of his car in the process. After tracking down Marge and the kids and loading them into the ripped-up car, Homer speeds away from New York City, vowing never to return.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\&quot;The Principal and the Pauper\\&quot;\n902 4F23\nOriginal Airdate: 9/28/97\n\nWill the real Seymour Skinner please stand up? A man named Seymour Skinner shows up in Springfield claiming that the man who works as Springfield Elementary School\\&amp;#039;s Principal is an imposter. It turns out that the Skinner who\\&amp;#039;s lived in Springfield all these years is really named Armin Tamzarian, and met the real Seymour Skinner in Vietnam. The real Skinner was a highly decorated Sergeant, while Tamzarian was a fifties-style greaser and juvenile delinquent. The real Skinner was captured by the enemy, held in a POW camp for five years and then sold to China as a slave forced to make sneakers in Wuhan. Tamzarian stole his name and identity, moved to Springfield and took over Skinner\\&amp;#039;s former life, even claiming the man\\&amp;#039;s mother, Agnes, to be his own. With the real Skinner back, the fake Skinner quits his job at the school, moves out of his mother\\&amp;#039;s house and starts a new life as a loser in Capital City. Meanwhile, the real Skinner takes over at Springfield Elementary School and proves to be much less bearable than the old Skinner. In desperation, Agnes Skinner, Mrs. Krabappel and the Simpsons travel to Capital City to beg Tamzarian to come back. With Tamzarian\\&amp;#039;s return, Sergeant Skinner is banished from town and everyone agrees to accept Tamzarian back as Principal Seymour Skinner. \n\nGuest Star: Martin Sheen as Sergeant Seymour Skinner\n\n\n\n\n\n\\&quot;Lisa\\&amp;#039;s Sax\\&quot;\n903 3G02\nOriginal Airdate: 10/19/97\n\nA walk down memory lane reveals the sad story of Bart\\&amp;#039;s first days in kindergarten. His dislike for school and problems making friends are exacerbated by the presence of his little sister, Lisa. While meeting with J. Loren Pryor, the Springfield Elementary School psychologist, few of Bart\\&amp;#039;s problems are resolved, but Homer and Marge discover that Lisa is a gifted child. Trying to foster her gift, they try to get her into a special school but can\\&amp;#039;t afford it. They decide to buy Lisa a musical instrument instead, thus beginning the girl\\&amp;#039;s eight-year love affair with the saxophone.\n\nGuest Star: Fyvush Finkel as Krusty the Clown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\&quot;Treehouse of Horror VIII\\&quot;\n904 5F02\nOriginal Airdate: 10/26/97\n\nThree new yucky Halloween yarns from your favorite yellow family. First, Homer seems to be the only survivor of a nuclear explosion. As the last living person on earth--literally, the Homega Man--Homer is free to do whatever he wants, specifically steal cars and crash them and dance naked in the Springfield Community Church. But Homer\\&amp;#039;s revelry is cut short by a band of angry, flesh-eating mutants who survived the blast and are now hungry for Homer. Speeding in a car to Evergreen Terrace, Homer hides in his old home and discovers that his family has also survived the blast, protected by the layers and layers of lead paint in the house. Marge and kids are elated to see Homer and it\\&amp;#039;s their pleasure to use their shotguns to blast holes in the mutants. In the second story, Homer buys a matter-transporting machine from Professor Frink\\&amp;#039;s yard sale. He uses it to grab beers from the fridge without getting up from the couch and to quickly go to the bathroom while watching TV. When Bart goes inside the machine with a fly, his DNA is scrambled with the insect\\&amp;#039;s and two new creatures emerge: A tiny fly with Bart\\&amp;#039;s head, and Bart\\&amp;#039;s body with a disgusting fly\\&amp;#039;s head. The family accepts the new bugged-out Bart, but when the tiny Bart tires of being a fly, it\\&amp;#039;s up to Lisa to trick the big Bart back into the machine so each pest\\&amp;#039;s DNA can be put back in the correct place. The final sequence is the story of a coven of Springfield witches from 1649. As played by Marge and her sisters Patty and Selma, the witches are kindly old souls who occasionally enjoy eating children from the town. To stop the witches from eating their kids, the townspeople offer them candy and treats instead, thus initating the tradition of Halloween.     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\&quot;The Cartridge Family\\&quot;\n905 5F01\nOriginal Airdate: 11/02/97\n\nThe only way to take Homer\\&amp;#039;s gun is to pry it from his lifeless, four-fingered hand. When a riot erupts at a Continental Soccer Association match, Homer buys a gun to protect his family. Marge is disgusted by his purchase but Homer loves his gun and starts attending NRA meetings with Moe, Dr. Hibbert and Apu. After Homer accidentally fires his gun during dinner, Marge sets an ultimatum: Either the gun leaves the house or she does. Well, Marge packs up the kids and moves to a motel, where Bart and Lisa have fun playing on the Magic Fingers bed. Homer comes to find his family at the motel and promises Marge he\\&amp;#039;ll throw the gun away. Just then, Snake robs the place and Homer saves the day with his firearm. But he still throws it away. When her husband\\&amp;#039;s not looking, Marge retrieves the gun from the trash and keeps it for herself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\&quot;Bart Star\\&quot;\n906 5F03\nOriginal Airdate: 11/09/97\n\nBart joins the Springfield Wildcats, a pee-wee football team. During games, Homer heckles Ned, the team\\&amp;#039;s coach, so much that he quits and makes Homer the coach. In his new role, Homer starts to show Bart special treatment, which alienates the boy from his teammates. Eventually, Bart quits the team but rejoins after he and Homer share a moment discussing the importance of teamwork. As a show of team loyalty, Bart allows himself to be arrested by Chief Wiggum, who is actually looking for Nelson Muntz, the Wildcats\\&amp;#039; star player. \n\nGuest Stars: Joe Namath and Roy Firestone as themselves; Mike Judge as Hank Hill\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\&quot;The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons\\&quot;\n907 5F04\nOriginal Airdate: 11/16/97\n\nApu\\&amp;#039;s mother writes him a letter reminding him of his arranged bride and that he must marry her soon. When his mother comes to town, Apu enlists Marge to pretend she is his wife. Meanwhile, Homer has checked himself into the Springfield Retirement Castle, enjoying the leisurely days and free meals. After a series of farcical encounters with Apu\\&amp;#039;s increasingly suspicious mother, Marge and Apu reveal the truth. Apu\\&amp;#039;s arranged marriage is back on in spite of his reservations. But when he meets Manjula, his bride-to-be, Apu is smitten by her beauty and her good taste in movies. The two are married and live happily every after. \nGuest Stars: Andrea Martin as Apu\\&amp;#039;s Mother; Jan Hooks as Manjula his bride-to-be, Apu is smitten by her beauty and her good taste in movies.

Everyone in town believes that it\\&amp;#039;s an angel\\&amp;#039;s skeleton, but Lisa Simpson tries to convince them otherwise. Homer steals the angel and sells tickets for people to visit it in his garage while Lisa chips off a tiny piece of bone and brings it to Harvard Professor Stephen Jay Gould for examination. The tests are inconclusive, but Lisa is still convinced that the skeleton is not an angel\\&amp;#039;s. When the angel disappears from Homer\\&amp;#039;s garage and reappears on a hill over Springfield with the words \\&quot;The End Will Come at Sundown\\&quot; chiseled into its base, everyone is convinced that it\\&amp;#039;s a sign from God. The entire town gathers on the hill to witness \\&quot;the end,\\&quot; but Lisa remains skeptical. When the angel begins to speak, everyone--including Lisa--shudders in awe. That awe soon disappears when it is revealed that the \\&quot;angel\\&quot; is merely a promotional stunt for the Heavenly Hills Mall, a new shopping center. Lisa was right, but as Marge points out, she did get awfully scared when it seemed like the angel was real.\n \nGuest Star: Stephen Jay Gould as himself\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\&quot;Realty Bites\\&quot;\n909 5F06\nOriginal Airdate: 12/07/97\n\nMarge pursues a new career in real estate sales while Homer is pursued by Snake. Marge starts working at Red Blazer Reality, a highly competitive company where she must sell a certain number of houses or be fired. Meanwhile, Homer buys Snake\\&amp;#039;s old car from a Police Auction and Snake isn\\&amp;#039;t too happy about it. Marge has trouble dealing with the fact that being an effective salesperson requires a lot of lying, and starts to wonder if she\\&amp;#039;s cut out for selling houses. But when she manages to get the Flanders to buy an impossible-to-sell house where a murder occurred, she thinks she\\&amp;#039;s getting the hang of it. Rather than be upset at the fact that they\\&amp;#039;ve moved into a crime scene, the Flanders are elated, since they\\&amp;#039;re strangely fascinated by the details of the murder. All is fine, until Homer and Snake crash Snake\\&amp;#039;s car through the Flanders\\&amp;#039; new house, destroying it. Marge is fired from Red Blazer Realty.   \n \n \n    \n\n\n \n \n\\&quot;Miracle on Evergreen Terrace\\&quot;\n910 5F07\nOriginal Airdate: 12/21/97\n\nWhen Bart accidentally destroys his family\\&amp;#039;s Christmas tree and all the presents underneath it on Christmas morning, he lies and says that he saw a burglar steal their stuff. A report by Kent Brockman about the supposed robbery leads to an outpouring of support and money for the Simpsons from the people of Springfield. Homer takes the money and buys a new car, which he promptly drives into the bottom of a lake. Bart finally admits that there was no burglar and that it was his fault that the Christmas tree and presents disappeared. When word gets out about the fraud, the entire town turns on the Simpsons, throwing rotten vegetables at them and sending them hate mail. Marge comes up with a foolproof plan to get the townspeople their money back: She goes on Jeopardy! to win the cash. When she loses, the family returns home to find that their neighbors have looted the entire house, thereby evening the score. \n\nGuest Star: Alex Trebek as himself\n   \n \n\n\n\n \n     \n \\&quot;All Singing, All Dancing\\&quot;\n911 5F24\nOriginal Airdate: 1/04/98\n\nThe Simpsons break out in song--over and over again--as we dance along memory lane and watch all of the musical interludes from the last eight seasons. Apu asks who needs the Kwik-E-Mart! The Maison Derriere puts the spring in Springfield! Shary Bobbins teaches Bart and Lisa to cut corners! The writers, meanwhile, sing and dance all the way to the bank as the editors put the show together. \n \n     \n \n\n\n\n\n\\&quot;Bart Carny\\&quot;\n912 5F08\nOriginal Airdate: 1/11/98\n\nBart and Homer get jobs working for a carnival. While there, they befriend Cooder and his son Spud. The friendship takes a turn for the worse when Cooder and Spud are forced to move in with the Simpsons. Eventually, Cooder and Spud \\&quot;steal\\&quot; the Simpsons\\&amp;#039; house by locking the family out and not letting them back in. The only way Homer can get the squatters out is to make a bet with them: If he can throw a hula hoop over the chimney, Cooder and Spud have to give him the house back; if he misses, they can keep it. But just before Homer throws the hula hoop, the Simpsons dash into the house and lock the carnies out. Cooder and Spud are once again homeless. \n\nGuest Star: Jim Varney as Cooder\n   \n \n \n     \n \n\n\n\\&quot;The Joy of Sect\\&quot;\n913 5F23\nOriginal Airdate: 2/08/98\n\nThe Simpsons join a religious sect called The Movementarians. The sect worships an all-powerful leader who claims that he will take his followers to the planet Blisstonia, where they will all live lives of uninterrupted happiness. Everyone takes to the Movementarian lifestyle, moving to a compound and working for the leader. But Marge is incredulous and flees the compound. Now free, she hires Groundskeeper Willie to kidnap her husband and kids and deprogram them. The kids return to their unwashed minds, but Homer appears to still believe in Movementarianism. He goes back to the compound and surprises his Movementarian friends by denouncing the leader and proving that his spaceship to Blisstonia is a fake. Because of Homer, the Movementarians disband.   \n \n \n     \n \n\n\n\n\n\\&quot;Das Bus\\&quot;\n914 5F11\nOriginal Airdate: 2/15/98\n\nThe children of Springfield Elementary School get stranded on a desert island on the way to a Model United Nations session. Trapped on the island with no grown-ups, the children form their own Lord of the Flies-style civilization. Meanwhile, back in Springfield, Homer starts up his own Internet company called CompuGlobalHyperMegaNet, which he sells to Bill Gates. On the island, civilization begins to break down when it appears that Milhouse has eaten their rations. During a show trial, Milhouse claims that a monster ate the food, but no one believes him. Eventually, it is revealed that a monster, actually a wild boar, did in fact eat all the food. The children, still starving, realize there\\&amp;#039;s only one thing to do: kill the boar and eat it. In the end, an omniscient narrator explains that the children eventually got off the island, perhaps thanks to Moe. \nGuest Star: James Earl Jones as the Narrator\n   \n \n \n     \n \n\n\n\\&quot;The Last Temptation of Krust\\&quot;\n915 5F10\nOriginal Airdate: 2/22/98\n\nWhen Krusty the Clown performs at a comedy festival with Jay Leno, Janeane Garofalo, Bobcat Goldthwait and other comics, he proves to everyone that his comedy style is hopelessly out of date. Standing beneath the hot lights, looking into the faces of an indifferent crowd, Krusty bombs with his racial humor and embarrassing gag tuxedo. Krusty calls a press conference to announce his retirement from show business, but during his farewell speech gets the best laughs of his career. Reborn as a caustic, hard-boiled stand-up comic, Krusty becomes a latter day Lenny Bruce, condemning corporations and sell-outs left and right. Audiences lap it up, but Krusty finds himself tempted to sell out again when two advertising executives from a car company want him to flak their all-terrain vehicle. The pile of money the ad men offer Krusty is enough to make him shed his new image and return to being a shill for the highest bidder. Krusty loses his fanbase, but gains a great new car and mountains of money. \nGuest Stars: Jay Leno, Janeane Garofalo, Steven Wright, Bobcat Goldthwait, Bruce Baum and Hank Williams, Jr. as themselves\n   \n \n \n     \n \n\n\n\\&quot;Dumbbell Indemnity\\&quot;\n916 5F12\nOriginal Airdate: 3/01/98\n\nMoe falls in love with a beautiful woman named Renee. Renee, against all odds, actually requites his love. During their courtship, a new, tender side of Moe is revealed. All Moe wants to do is buy Renee gifts, and eventually he spends all of his money on her. Broke, he concocts a scheme that should net him some quick cash. Moe figures he can have his car stolen and then collect from his insurance company. The plan is brilliant, but Moe\\&amp;#039;s first mistake is asking Homer to help him. Instead of following Moe\\&amp;#039;s instructions exactly, Homer bungles his part of the plan and winds up in jail. Collecting the insurance money, Moe is torn between using it to take Renee on a romantic Hawaiian vacation or bailing his friend and erstwhile accomplice out of the pokey. Realizing it\\&amp;#039;s time to fess up, Moe tells Renee of his financial problems and how he tried to solve them. She is accepting at first, but when Moe tells her he has another insurance scheme that will fix everything, she is disgusted and leaves him. Moe carries out this new plan, burning down his tavern and nearly killing himself and Homer in the process. Barney winds up saving his two buddies (after first saving a couple of beer kegs), and Homer allows Moe to use his house as a bar until his friend is back on his feet financially. \nGuest Star: Helen Hunt as Renee\n   \n \n \n     \n \n\n\n\\&quot;Lisa the Simpson\\&quot;\n917 4F24\nOriginal Airdate: 3/01/98\n\nWhen Lisa is unable to figure out a simple brain teaser, she begins to fear that she is losing her gift of intelligence. Soon, she is noticing tons of clues that suggest her intellectual decline. Listening to Lisa\\&amp;#039;s complaints, Grandpa explains to her that all Simpsons--himself, Homer, and others--started out smart and gradually experienced a \\&quot;dumbening\\&quot; that left them thick as bricks. Lisa decides to give over to the dumbening, emulating Homer and Bart and their brainless ways. But this makes Lisa unhappy, so to cheer her up, Homer gathers all the Simpson relatives he can find and tries to show her that they\\&amp;#039;re not all idiots. Sadly, Lisa realizes that a lot of them are, in fact, stupid. But when she meets some of her female relatives, she is pleased to discover that many of them are doctors and businesswomen. With renewed confidence in her own intelligence, Lisa looks at the brain teaser again and figures it out immediately.   \n \n \n     \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\\&quot;This Little Wiggy\\&quot;\n918 5F13\nOriginal Airdate: 3/22/98\n\nWhen Marge meets Ralph Wiggum, she decides to invite him over for a playdate with Bart. Bart initially rejects Ralph, but when he goes over to the Wiggum household and sees that it\\&amp;#039;s filled with police equipment and files, he finds himself in a troublemaker\\&amp;#039;s paradise. The two boys start hanging out more and more, eventually having a sleepover during which they steal Chief Wiggum\\&amp;#039;s master key and let themselves into every building in Springfield. In the middle of their spree, Bart and Ralph run into Nelson and his bully buddies. Trying to impress them, Bart shows them the master key and the whole group ventures into the abandoned prison. While there, they play with the electric chair, but leave before they can use the key to turn it off again. When Mayor Quimby decides to reopen the prison, he calls a press conference and sits in the electric chair to demonstrate how it works. Watching the event on TV, Bart and Ralph are sure that Quimby will be killed if anyone flips the electric chair switch. With a little help from Mr. Burns, however, the mayor escapes his fate. After going through so much together, Bart and Ralph remain friends.   \n \n \n     \n \n\n\n\n\\&quot;Simpson Tide\\&quot;\n919 3G04\nOriginal Airdate: 3/29/98\n\nHomer, Barney and Moe join the Naval Reserve. During a routine drill, the would-be seamen find themselves trapped in a nuclear submarine in very real combat with another squadron. When Homer accidentally ejects Captain Tenille, the submarine\\&amp;#039;s chief, he is put in charge of the vessel. The sub gets lost and coasts all the way to Russia. What\\&amp;#039;s worse, it springs a leak and is rapidly filling up with water. Eventually, Homer saves his men and narrowly averts a nuclear conflict with the Russians. He is court-martialed, however, and forced to return to his normal life.\n\nGuest Star: Rod Steiger as Captain Tenille \n \n     \n \n\n\n\n\n\\&quot;The Trouble With Trillions\\&quot;\n920 5F14\nOriginal Airdate: 4/05/98\n\nIn order to avoid an audit, Homer serves as an IRS spy in a sting operation targeting Mr. Burns. We learn that, many years earlier, a younger Burns was entrusted with the task of delivering the only one trillion-dollar bill ever minted to a shattered post-war Europe. The government\\&amp;#039;s logic was that America\\&amp;#039;s wealthiest man would never steal the money; of course, they were wrong. Now it\\&amp;#039;s up to Homer to recover the trillion, but when he realizes that he\\&amp;#039;s working for the agency that has exploited him all these years, he joins up with his boss and flees to Cuba with the money. While there, Homer, Burns and Smithers meet with Fidel Castro, who swipes the trillion-dollar bill and sends the men packing. Floating back to America on a refugee raft, Burns decides that he\\&amp;#039;ll simply buy his way out of this most recent problem and everything returns to normal. \nGuest Star: Paul Winfield as Lucius Sweet\n   \n \n \n     \n \n\n\n\\&quot;Girly Edition\\&quot;\n921 5F15\nOriginal Airdate: 4/19/98\n\nLisa becomes the anchorwoman for a children\\&amp;#039;s news program. Bart is also hired for the show and launches a series of trite human-interest stories that attract a lot attention and overshadow Lisa\\&amp;#039;s more serious work. Meanwhile, Homer claims he\\&amp;#039;s handicapped so he can adopt a trained monkey named Mojo, who will wait on him hand and foot. As Bart\\&amp;#039;s star is on the rise, Lisa devises a plot to destroy his career by having him do a segment on Groundskeeper Willie, who hates Bart for destroying his shack. Lisa gets more than she bargained for when Willie tries to kill Bart. She saves Bart\\&amp;#039;s life using the same soft, human-interest speak that her brother pioneered in his segments. Back at home, Mojo has become fat and lazy after emulating Homer\\&amp;#039;s ways. Homer returns Mojo to the animal shelter and learns to fetch his own beer again.   \n \n \n     \n \n\n\n\n\\&quot;Trash of the Titans\\&quot;\n922 5F09\nOriginal Airdate: 4/26/98\n\nAfter a spat with some garbage men, Homer decides to run for the position of Sanitation Commissioner. He takes on the current commissioner, Ray Patterson, who is endorsed by the members of U2, and wins the election by making wild campaign promises. As the new Sanitation Commissioner, Homer tries to institute policies such as around-the-clock service, shiny new uniforms for garbage men, and free car washes. Homer\\&amp;#039;s initiatives are so costly that he spends an entire year\\&amp;#039;s budget in one month, and must raise money by allowing other towns to use Springfield\\&amp;#039;s abandoned mines as garbage dumps. With trash forcing its way up through the ground and overrunning Springfield, the townspeople beg Ray Patterson to return to his job. Patterson refuses. As a last resort, the entire town of Springfield is moved to another tract of land fives miles away. \nGuest Stars: Steve Martin as Ray Patterson; Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen as themselves\n   \n \n \n     \n \n\n\n\\&quot;King of the Hill\\&quot;\n923 5F16\nOriginal Airdate: 5/03/98\n\nAfter undertaking an intense workout regimen, Homer becomes a buffed-out specimen of a man. With the help of his gym buddy Rainer Wolfcastle, Homer becomes stronger and leaner than ever. He soon attracts the attention of Brad and Neil, two executives from the company that makes Powersauce health bars. Brad and Neil enlist Homer to climb to the top of the Murderhorn, the tallest, most forbidding mountain in Springfield, as a promotional stunt for Powersauce bars. With the help of two sherpas, Homer embarks on the arduous climb. Under his own power, Homer can barely make it halfway up the mountain. But while he sleeps, the two sherpas drag his sleeping bag behind them and get him to the top. When Homer discovers that the sherpas have been carrying them, he fires them and continues up to the peak. He doesn\\&amp;#039;t quite make it, but he does manage to drive a stake into one of the Murderhorn\\&amp;#039;s plateaus and cause the peak to collapse, making the spot where he is standing the default top of the hill. His climb is a success, sort of. \nGuest stars: Brendan Fraser as Brad; Steven Weber as Neil\n   \n \n \n     \n \n\\&quot;Lost Our Lisa\\&quot;\n924 5F17\nOriginal Airdate: 5/10/98\nWhen Lisa cons Homer into letting her ride the bus alone to the Springsonian Museum for the \\&quot;Treasures of Isis\\&quot; exhibit, she gets lost along the way.
