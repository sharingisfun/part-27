The presentation is in the Men ngag style, a personal instruction distilling Nuden&amp;#039;s Dorje&amp;#039;s own realization in a manner both beautiful and deeply meaningful. Short verses show, with pity clarity, how the various aspects of Dzogchen fit together.\n\nThe commentary by James Low, a student of the fourth incarnation of Nuden Dorje for thirty years, explains the pivotal practices and addresses difficulties that arise in meditation. Given during a retreat in the presence of the lineage holder, it provides both an expansion of the traditional concepts embodied in the text and an examination of how they can function in contemporary life.\n\nDzogchen, often considered the highest practice in Tibetan Buddhism, is an ancient system of realizing one&amp;#039;s own authentic nature. Carrying on an unbroken line of transmission, this text presents a traditional consideration of the system&amp;#039;s key points. It speaks to the heart of the human condition, highlighting the need to integrate all the aspects of one&amp;#039;s being. In the process, the practitioner learns to overcome fear, anxiety and denial.\nscan by miroku","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:342f96d835e4419e52a106ef70b973e12274a319","amp;dn":"being+right+here+-+a+dzogchen+trasure+text+of+nuden+dorje+entitl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"342f96d835e4419e52a106ef70b973e12274a319","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,47,150,216,53,228,65,158,82,161,6,239,112,185,115,225,34,116,163,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
