It was released on their 1967 album Smiley Smile with Al Jardine and Brian Wilson on lead vocals.\n\n\nAll versions of the song feature the novel use of vegetable chewing as percussion. During the Smile sessions, Paul McCartney was recorded chewing celery. Al Jardine remembers that &quot;the night before a big tour, I was out in the studio recording the vocal [for 'Vegetables'] when, to my surprise, Paul McCartney walked in and joined Brian at the console. And, briefly, the two most influential musical Geminis in the world had a chance to work together. I remember waiting for long periods of time between takes to get to the next section or verse. Brian [seemed to have] lost track of the session. Paul would come on the talkback and say something like 'Good take, Al.'&quot;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetables_%28song%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetables_%28song%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo:\n\nPublisher: Nowhereman Records\n\nReference: nm004\n\nDate: 2009\n\nMade In: Friendship\n\nBooklet &amp; packaging: Front, Back, Inner (With liner notes)\n\nTotal duration: 79:47\n\n\nComments:\n\nBrian Wilson wrote the song &quot;Vegatables&quot; (with Van Dyke Parks) for the famous ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSMiLEÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ album, planned for 1967, but due to the cancellation of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSMiLEÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, it was released in a much toned-down form on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSmiley SmileÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ instead, (with Al Jardine and Brian Wilson on lead vocals) with one section cut out and later reused as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMama SaysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ on the album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWild HoneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nPaul McCartney was in the studio when Brian Wilson was mixing this song, he just walked in and joined Brian at the console. And, briefly, the two most influential musical Geminis in the world had a chance to work together - you can hear him in the background munching on celery (used instead of traditional percussion) and saying something like 'Good take, Al'.\n\nIn 1993, the previously unreleased original version of Vegetables was released along with a slew of other ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSMiLEÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ material on the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGood VibrationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ box-set. In 2004, the song was included on Brian Wilson's new release of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSMiLEÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. This most recent recording was based on the original version, rather than the minimalist arrangement that appears on Smiley Smile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 - Tables (Part 1 - Piano Track)picpic02 - Tables (Part 1 - Vocal Overdub)\n03 - Tables (Part 1 - Vocal Overdub Attempt)\n04 - Tables Stereo (Part 1 - Instrumental &amp; Vocal Overdub Attempts)\n05 - Tables Stereo (Part 1 - Instrumental &amp; Vocal Overdub Attempts)\n06 - Tables Stereo (Part 1 - Instrumental &amp; Vocal Overdub Attempts)\n07 - Tables (Part 1 - Vocal Overdub Attempts)\n08 - Tables (Part 1 - Vocal Overdub\n09 - Tables (Part 1 - Vocal Overdub Attempts)\n10 - Tables (Part 1 - Vocal Overdub Attempts)\n11 - Tables (Part 1 - Instrumental Insert Takes 1-8)\n12 - Tables (Part 1 - Vocal Insert Rehearsals)\n13 - Tables (Part 1 - Mono Mix Rehearsals)\n14 - Tables (Part 2 - Take Unknown)\n15 - Tables (Part 2 - 1St Vocal Overdub)\n16 - Tables (Part 2 - 2Nd Vocal Overdub)\n17 - Tables (Part 2 - Track Rehearsal)\n18 - Tables (Part 2 - 1St Vocal Overdub)\n19 - Tables (Part 2 - 2Nd Vocal Overdub)\n20 - Tables (Part 2 - 3Rd Vocal Overdub\n21 - Tables (Part 2 - 4Th Vocal Overdub)\n22 - Tables (Part 2 - Mono Mix)\n23 - Tables (Part 3 - Take 12)\n24 - Tables (Part 3 - 1St Vocal Overdub)\n25 - Tables (Part 3 - 2Nd Vocal Overdub)\n26 - Tables (Part 3 - Mono Mix)\n27 - Tables (Various Mix Rehearsals)\n28 - Tables (Smile Mix)\n29 - Vegetables (Bass Rehearsal)\n30 - Vegetables (Bass Track)\n31 - Vegetables (Bass &amp; Piano Track)\n32 - Vegetables (1St Vocal Overdub)\n33 - Vegetables (2Nd Vocal Overdub)\n34 - Vegetables (Instrumental Insert)\n35 - Tables - Great Shape (Vigotone Smile Mix)\n36 - Tables (Smile Millennium Edition)\n37 - Tables Reprise (Smile Millennium Edition)\n38 - Tables (Purple Chick Smile)\n39 - Tables (Purple Chick Smile - Vocals Only Bonus)\n\n\nMore details on Bootlegzone:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAS ALWAYS: ENJOY &amp; REMEMBER TO KEEP SEEDING FOR OTHERS!!!\nTHANKS!!\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bdd1cb03fb1cc2e607db89c7f9488c04da61478","amp;dn":"The+Beach+Boys+%26amp%3B+Paul+McCartney+-+Vega-Tables+%281966+Sessions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bdd1cb03fb1cc2e607db89c7f9488c04da61478","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,221,28,176,63,177,204,46,96,125,184,156,127,148,136,192,77,166,20,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
