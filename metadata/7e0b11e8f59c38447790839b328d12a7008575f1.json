The job interviews are as unique as The Shed itself, including on-stage auditions, a trip to the legendary Shed &quot;junkyard&quot; and a visit with the one and only Shed Pimps. Meanwhile, a hungry alligator has crept out of the bayou and into the Shed Garden farm, so it's up to Daddy-O, Big Hoss and Coal Miner to lure the critter away from their tomatoes.\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 12-Aug-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e0b11e8f59c38447790839b328d12a7008575f1","amp;dn":"The.Shed.S01E03.HDTV.x264-OMiCRON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e0b11e8f59c38447790839b328d12a7008575f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,11,17,232,245,156,56,68,119,144,131,155,50,141,18,167,0,133,117,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
