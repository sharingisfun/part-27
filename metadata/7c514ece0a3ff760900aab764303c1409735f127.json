But a few plants have hit upon an especially ingenious approach to ensuring their survival, producing chemicals that have the power to alter how humans experience the world.\n\nCannabisÃ¢â‚¬â€more commonly known as marijuanaÃ¢â‚¬â€seems to have long ago adopted a strategy of tying its fortunes to humans, appealing in particular to our innate desire to alter consciousness, a desire that spans nearly every culture and historical period. In exchange, humans have gone to extraordinary lengths, often at their own peril, to help the plant grow and reproduce.\nThough marijuana has been in use in one form or another for as long as history has been recorded, the plant has undergone its greatest transformation only in the last few decades. Ironically, that change occurred just at the moment when the future of the plant seemed most in doubt.\n\n\nCheck this account for updates regularly :)\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c514ece0a3ff760900aab764303c1409735f127","amp;dn":"Cannabis+Collection+-+PBS+-+Botany+of+Desire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c514ece0a3ff760900aab764303c1409735f127","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,81,78,206,10,63,247,96,144,10,171,118,67,3,193,64,151,53,241,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
