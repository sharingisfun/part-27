So I ripped my platinum edition of S.E.O.D. at 320 and since my Bigger than the Devil CD  is MIA I grabbed a 320 of it elsewhere.  I hope you enjoy and please seed as I will not be sole seeding for more than a few days so help me out folks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfe16b1b697cc061a40a1d2af88418ad04b3a3ec","amp;dn":"Stormtroopers+Of+Death+%2F+S.O.D.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfe16b1b697cc061a40a1d2af88418ad04b3a3ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,225,107,27,105,124,192,97,164,10,29,42,248,132,24,173,4,179,163,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
