Always outnumbered, Hannibal planned meticulously and never lost a war against Rome in 16 years of battle. On the other hand, he never conquered Rome. So was his career triumph or tragedy? How about General MacArthur, whose surprise landing at Inchon, South Korea, led to immediate triumph and, later, embarrassing failure? KluthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s main thesis seems to be that triumph and tragedy, success and failure, are merely points on a line, and that we make our way in life by cultivating the ability to turn failure into success and recognizing that success can breed failure, if weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not careful. This isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the first book to tackle this subject, but its historical perspective, drawing on the life of a warrior who lived more than two millennia ago, gives it fresh appeal. --David Pitt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3a4779efc6e28408296ad265360254001253003","amp;dn":"HANNIBAL+AND+ME%3A+What+History%27s+Greatest+Military+Strategist+Can","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3a4779efc6e28408296ad265360254001253003","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,164,119,158,252,110,40,64,130,150,173,38,83,96,37,64,1,37,48,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
