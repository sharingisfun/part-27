It is the band's first album to include Blaze Bayley, formerly of Wolfsbane, as vocalist, replacing Bruce Dickinson who left the band following their previous tour to pursue a solo career. \n\nIt is considered Iron Maiden's darkest album due to the lyrics being based on personal issues surrounding Steve Harris at the time, who was in the midst of a divorce and the death of his father, and the album cover, which depicts the band's mascot, Eddie, being graphically mutilated through surgery.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo. \t\t\n1. \t&quot;Sign of the Cross&quot;   \t\t11:17\n2. \t&quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;    \t        5:03\n3. \t&quot;Man on the Edge&quot;   \t\t4:13\n4. \t&quot;Fortunes of War&quot;   \t \t7:23\n5. \t&quot;Look for the Truth&quot;   \t        5:10\n6. \t&quot;The Aftermath&quot;   \t\t6:20\n7. \t&quot;Judgement of Heaven&quot;   \t5:12\n8. \t&quot;Blood on the World's Hands&quot;  \t5:57\n9. \t&quot;The Edge of Darkness&quot;   \t6:39\n10. \t&quot;2 A.M.&quot;   \t\t        5:37\n11. \t&quot;The Unbeliever&quot;   \t\t8:10\n\nTotal length:                           71:01\n\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcce64619f767962634e82207435fb66db8033ef","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+%281995%29+The+X+Factor+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcce64619f767962634e82207435fb66db8033ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,206,100,97,159,118,121,98,99,78,130,32,116,53,251,102,219,128,51,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
