As an outsider, Mork is unfamiliar with human customs and often questions some of the strange traditions that we take for granted. Much of the humor relies on Williams\\&amp;#039; unique comic voices and mannerisms. The show was perhaps most famous for Mork\\&amp;#039;s saying, \\&amp;#039;nanoo nanoo.\\&amp;#039;  Written by Tad Dibbern {&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;17535e55555245594853577626397a64747139626772797939727362&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;}\n\nMork is a bumbling alien from the planet Mork sent to Earth, in his egg, to study it\\&amp;#039;s inhabitants. He will report to his unseen superior, Orson, until reassigned. On Earth, he meets Mindy McConnell, an average woman who takes him in and shelters him. On befriending Mork, she signs herself up for some wacky adventures as Mork learns about human life, acting (and looking) very eccentric along the way. In addition to spouting \\&quot;nanoo, nanoo\\&quot;, Mork had an uncanny ability to impersonate celebrity voices. Eventually, the relationship between Mork and Mindy jumped from a strong friendship to romance, and they married, eventually bearing a son, Mearth from Earth, who aged backwards like his father.
