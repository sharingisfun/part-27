I cannot express how awesome this band is, really a good find I stumbled upon awhile back.\n\nFrom the Last.fm page: (sorry, no wikipedia!)\nA darkwave band from Tampa, Florida, Butterfly Messiah have released two albums: Priestess (2000) and Eternal (2004). Butterfly Messiah disbanded in 2005, with members Shannon Lyn Garson and Robert Davis turning their attentions to a new project, The Seahorse Orchestra. Joshua Harrington went on to join post rock band Petrograd In Transit as well as continuing his solo career.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df065a8c7f38fe175c18ec6b709e373d47379cd2","amp;dn":"Buttessiah+-+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df065a8c7f38fe175c18ec6b709e373d47379cd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,6,90,140,127,56,254,23,92,24,236,107,112,158,55,61,71,55,156,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
