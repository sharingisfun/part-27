It took me about 2 years to work this album out (1977-1979). I had an exiting time finding out how the different worlds of film or radio could meet in a piece of music as if they would have belonged together from the very beginning. And it was also a pleasure to play all instruments myself if only possible. I wished that music would become a perfect carrier to an imaginable new and visionary world and it should become a pleasure to the human ear to follow the music on this trip&quot;.\nRecorded at Inner Space Studio.\nMixed at Conny's Studio.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17e6d5419e9820993e92726b6e28ff1f21a75a73","amp;dn":"Holger+Czukay+-+%5B1979%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17e6d5419e9820993e92726b6e28ff1f21a75a73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,230,213,65,158,152,32,153,62,146,114,107,110,40,255,31,33,167,90,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
