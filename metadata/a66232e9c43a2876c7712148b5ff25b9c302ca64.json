The only adult she admires is Johnny Rotten&quot;\n\nPart of the gritty, punk-inspired wave of US independent cinema of the early 1980s, Out of the Blue is a bleak, harrowing drama. Essentially the vision of actor and director Dennis Hopper, the film finds the man behind the sepia-tinged soul searching of Easy Rider at a far lower ebb, in terms of the tone of the film and his own character, Donny. The undoubted star of the movie, however, is Linda Manz, who plays the troubled 15-year-old CB, a troubled teenage girl on the brink of adulthood. Waiting for Donny to return from a jail sentence for manslaughter, CB is living with her drug-addicted mother and seeking solace in the Sex Pistols and Elvis Presley. The events that unfold on Donny&amp;#039;s return are often unbearably grim (the final scenes are practically unwatchable) but produce a movie that is worthy of its hallowed status. Hopper in particular is an uncomfortable sight, made all the more unsettling by the knowledge that it is hard to tell where his character ends and he begins. It&amp;#039;s hard work, but more than worth the effort. \n\n File     :  701 MB (701 MB),  duration: 1:32:57,  type: AVI,  1 audio stream(s)\n Video :  636 MB,  957 Kbps,  23.976 fps,  512*384 (4:3),  XVID = XVID Mpeg-4\n Audio :  65 MB,  97 Kbps,  48000 Hz,  2 channels,  0x55 = MPEG Layer-3,  VBR\n\n\nScreens:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/outoftb01.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/outoftb01.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/outoftb02.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/outoftb02.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/outoftb03.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/outoftb03.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/outoftb04.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/outoftb04.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a66232e9c43a2876c7712148b5ff25b9c302ca64","amp;dn":"Dennis+Hopper+-+Out+Of+The+Blue+%281980%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a66232e9c43a2876c7712148b5ff25b9c302ca64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,98,50,233,196,58,40,118,199,113,33,72,181,255,37,185,195,2,202,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
