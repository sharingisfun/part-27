In this uniquely compelling history, reformed career criminal Terry Smith brings the benefit of hard-won wisdom to his analysis of all the major cases. Casting a sharp eye over both the dangerously devil-may-care Ã¢â‚¬ËœblaggerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and the more organised professional Ã¢â‚¬ËœvillainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, he brings an insiderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s point of view to the most high-profile armed robberies of the past 50 years. Each chapter has a full and comprehensive account of the robbery in the words of those who participated in it (including some exclusive interview material), the media, police and court records Ã¢â‚¬â€œ starting from the initial spark through to the planning, organisation and execution of the crime, and how it came to be solved by law enforcement","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d88dde5e8de42fd3365120962565245e197a2e74","amp;dn":"Terry+Smith+-+Blaggers+Inc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d88dde5e8de42fd3365120962565245e197a2e74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,141,222,94,141,228,47,211,54,81,32,150,37,101,36,94,25,122,46,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
