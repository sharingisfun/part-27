Ben Grimm, aka the Thing, might be pigeon-holed by some as little more than the brutish muscle of the MarvelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s super-science squad, but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s much more than that. He was one of the first flawed heroes in comics, breaking the mold and the majesty of DCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heroes and forging the way for the unique brand of heroes Marvel would go on to develop. The Thing is one of the first heroes with problems, and being cursed with his craggy skin-type was only more of the same.\n\nHailing from New YorkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Lower East Side, Ben Grimm came from the school of hard knocks and in his superhero identity heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fought everything from street gangs to dictators to cosmic forces beyond comprehension. Heck, was even a pro wrestler. They say as you get older, every wrinkle tells a story; in the case of Ben Grimm, every crack in his stony exterior is an adventure waiting to be told over a cold beer.&quot;\n\nTo add to that, I think The Ever-Lovin' Blue Eyed Thing gets shortchanged quite a bit - he is the only member of the Fantastic Four that isn't related by blood or marriage, yet he has always been the loyalest friend and ally imaginable and is considered part of their family. Forever cursed with his rocky exterior and often longing to change back, still he has repeatedly given up chances to revert to human form for the greater good. He is in love with a woman who can't see him and that relationship has gone through many ups and downs. However, no matter what the odds are against him, he always fights to the bitter end, with his trademark catchphrase &quot;IT'S CLOBBERIN' TIME!&quot; ever at the ready. How can you not love this guy?\n\nSo this collection celebrates 45 years of great stories about Ben Grimm. I have previously uploaded both the first 4 and the last 5 years of Fantasic Four issues in digital form; I did not add material from those here. However, excepting that, I think it is fair to say that I tracked down nearly ever significant story about The Thing I could find, including all critical team-ups, solo adventures and key FF tales. Many limited series are also featured as well as full runs of the The Thing v1 and v2. Several legenda of the industry are featured as well, including Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Barry Windsor-Smith and John Byrne.

All scanners are listed in the titles of the folders or the files wherever applicable except for the one-volume Strange Tales edition I created, which is credited to BluePeter + Flatterman. any uncredited files are likely early scans by DCP or other such groups. MASSIVE thanks to all the groups out there, without whom none of these great comics would be available. PLEASE SEED this one - it's big, but worth it! As always, enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e045736cd70416649df498f6eadb77c7a67412b8","amp;dn":"The+Ben+Grimm+%5BThe+Thing%5D+Collection+%281964-2009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e045736cd70416649df498f6eadb77c7a67412b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,69,115,108,215,4,22,100,157,244,152,246,234,219,119,199,166,116,18,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
