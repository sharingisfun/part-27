This software makes your desktop the best one out there beside the ones that already have this program. The program makes you computer look like it running on Linux, but wait it is running on Windows or Macintosh. It is so amazing and it is better than Yodm 3D. This company made updates to it that making you want to never go back to Yodm 3D. The RAR file that I am letting you guys or girls to look at and experience has a file that you copy. Then you paste in the folder that the DeskSpace data is contained in. This will unlock the program to be not a trial and will be the full version. The only problem is that not every computer can handle the program, which will make your computer lag and make your CPU over run. That is not good because making your CPU run will make your hard drive get really hot and you will eventually burn out sectors in your hard drive that contains your data. SO PLEASE READ THE INFORMATION PROVIDE BELOW!!!!!! Also, this RAR file does not contain any virus, unlike the other ones, so do not worry about downloading this file. Hope you enjoy this torrent and PLEASE SEED THE TORRENT FOR AT LEAST A WEEK.
