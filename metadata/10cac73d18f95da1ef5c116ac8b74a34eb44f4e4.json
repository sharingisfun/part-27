So basically it has better sound quality than other torrents. The stream coming out from iTunes is probably already lossy, then everyone records it and re-converts it to MP3, that's a lot of loss. What I did was I recorded it to WAV and didn't re-compress it to a lossy codec a second time.  I understand a lot of you won't care about that, but for those who know what this is, enjoy!\n\nAnd please, buy the damn album when it comes out!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10cac73d18f95da1ef5c116ac8b74a34eb44f4e4","amp;dn":"%5Bfixed%5D+Avenged+Sevenfold+-+Hail+to+the+King+%282013%29+%5BiTunes+stre","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10cac73d18f95da1ef5c116ac8b74a34eb44f4e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,202,199,61,24,249,93,161,239,92,17,106,200,183,74,52,235,68,244,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
