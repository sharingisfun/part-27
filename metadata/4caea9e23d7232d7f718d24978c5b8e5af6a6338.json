And there's no better short book that explains just what Einstein did than Einstein's Cosmos. Keying Einstein's crucial discoveries to the simple mental images that inspired them, Michio Kaku finds a revealing new way to discuss these ideas, and delivers an appealing and always accessible introduction to Einstein's work.\n\nFrom Scientific American:\nThanks to Kaku's insight (he is a theoretical physicist) and his flair for explaining dense scientific concepts (he is a best-selling author), this brief book weaves Einstein's life and work into a seamless, hard-to-put-down narrative. The organizing metaphor is how Einstein thought in terms of simple physical pictures--speeding trains, falling elevators, moving clocks. Excellent for the neophyte or readers who want to refresh their knowledge about Einstein without being talked down to or bored.\n\nFrom Booklist\nRecent popular works about Einstein have magnified select details of his life, such as his tempestuous marriage to Mileva Maric (Einstein in Love, by Dennis Overbye, 2000) or his FBI file (The Einstein File, by Fred Jerome [BKL Ap 1 03]). Such topics are reduced to paragraphs in Kaku's presentation, for Einstein's life ranks second to his science here. Accordingly, Kaku divides his narrative into the three great segments of Einstein's scientific arc: the theory of special relativity in 1905; the theory of general relativity in 1916; and the balance of Einstein's intellectual life. The latter was spent searching for a unified field theory and saw the rise of his phenomenal celebrity, which his peers regarded as a dubious dissipation of genius. However, such lamentations were premature, according to Kaku, who explicates recent discoveries that show Einstein was only audaciously ahead of his scientific time, as usual. An expert in quantum mechanics and string theory, Kaku is an equally able popular writer, vividly evoking the pictorial imagination behind Einstein's revolutionary thinking.
