The Tutman boys run a vegiterian cafe where they serve vegiterians. They dig up their dead uncle &amp; put his brain in a jar so he can give them instructions on how to resurrect the goddess Sheetar. Sheetar must be compiled from the body parts of many immoral girls &amp; brought to life at the blood buffet.\n\nThe soundtrack for this movie is awesome. Jackie Kong also directed a movie called Night Patrol which I believe inspired Police Academy. Blood Diner is an obscure little film that is very hard to find. The first copy I ever got was a VHS I bought from a pawn shop on a whim for $1.00. It was probably the best dollar I ever spent. I own this movie on DVD, but I wanted to download it so I can share it with the rest of the world.\n\nPlease reseed &amp; enjoy this timeless classic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32d0147a48fffbe62f6f64f3d5b1e76c90d85134","amp;dn":"Blood.Diner.1987.XviD.hyphield","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32d0147a48fffbe62f6f64f3d5b1e76c90d85134","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,208,20,122,72,255,251,230,47,111,100,243,213,177,231,108,144,216,81,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
