There was little standing in their way in the desolate second half of the 1990s; how could they not explode in the face of such forgettable acts as Creed and Barenaked Ladies? Verbenas blend of visceral but well-crafted post-grunge fused the twang and swagger of late 60s/early 70s Rolling Stones with darker elements of punk, 1980s alt-rock and even late-era Beatles. They also had a hot chic with a great voice. Most importantly they could write actual SONGS, with melodies that stuck in your head and lyrics that didnt require spoon-feeding. Many of todays bands would do well to take note.\n\nFormed in Birmingham, Alabama, in the early 1990s by Scott Bondy and three high school friends, the band shuffled through a couple of lineup and name changes, eventually settling on Verbena and earning a deserved reputation for the intensity of their live shows. They released a couple of singles and an EP on Merge Records ahead of their debut LP Souls For Sale (1996), a ten-stack of infinitely hummable rockers and brooders. By 1997 they were opening for The Jesus Lizard and even the Foo Fighters. Verbena labored against criticisms that they sounded too much like Nirvana, particularly following their sophomore release and Capitol Records debut Into The Pink (1999), produced by Dave Grohl. The Nirvana comparison was understandable, but the influence manifested more as innuendo than idolatry. Frontman, guitarist and primary songwriter Bondy could slay you just as easily with a ballad as he could with a barre chord ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ not unlike Kurt Cobain. His edgy yet introspective vocals could stand just fine on their own, but the gorgeous harmonies produced with guitarist/bassist and one-time romantic muse Anne Marie Griffin gave Verbena a flavor that defied comparison. She quit the band during the tour that followed Into The Pink, but shes immortalized as the tall drink of water in a long dress in the Baby Got Shot video, which cycled through MTV2 in mid-1999.\n\nThe third and final LP, La Musica Negra (2003), was promoted as much if not more than its predecessor (I remember seeing them play Way Out West on Letterman), and the trio toured extensively to support it, often billing themselves as The Alabama Boys Choir. They were now sporting a new bassist, but drummer Les Nuby carried on with Bondy as the two remaining founders. It wasnt to last, though; Verbena disbanded the same year. By this point I suspect too much had changed, both internally and externally. Bondy once revealed in an interview that he was surprised Capitol Records kept them on as long as they did, given their sluggish unit sales compared to some of his label mates. Still, Verbena left behind a legacy of solid songwriting and soulful guitar hooks that spanned 3 albums, 2 EPs and a handful of singles over nearly a decade. Bondy now lives in the Catskill Mountains of upstate New York, where in early 2007 he began recording alternative folk as A.A. Bondy (he was born Auguste Arthur Bondy). He quickly built a new following of his own, touring on both sides of the pond and releasing three respectable solo albums, including the recent Believers in September 2011 on Fat Possum Records.\n\nEach of Verbenas CDs enjoyed heavy rotation in my car stereo throughout my late twenties and early thirties; I had an infant at home, so my daily commute became my sound booth - the rare place I could crank my tunes and scream along with impunity. Many of the names on my CD cases have changed now, but the ritual has not. And Verbena still makes the odd appearance, their blend no less potent. -jimclip\n\n--------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cd341ef0a0c230ebbd1bc11719042d10ffa75ff","amp;dn":"Verbena+-+Complete+Discography+EAC-FLAC+%28jimclip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cd341ef0a0c230ebbd1bc11719042d10ffa75ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,211,65,239,10,12,35,14,187,209,188,17,113,144,66,209,15,250,117,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
