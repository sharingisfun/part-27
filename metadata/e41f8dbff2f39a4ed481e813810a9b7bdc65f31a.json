The visuals added very little to the power of the work, so I decided to rip it.\n\nIn his inimical, honest and impassioned style, Tony Benn describes the historical struggle for the protection of the masses from a small number of powerful people, and the present state of Democracy in the UK and America.\n\nIf you can spare 30 minutes and some bandwidth I highly recommend having a listen. It&amp;#039;s easy to understand and very \n\npowerful. \n\nThe original video can be found here\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3368442/Big_Ideas_That_Changed_the_World_-_Tony_Benn_on_Democracy_(2005).&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3368442/Big_Ideas_That_Changed_the_World_-_Tony_Benn_on_Democracy_(2005).&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e41f8dbff2f39a4ed481e813810a9b7bdc65f31a","amp;dn":"Tony+Benn+-+Democracy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e41f8dbff2f39a4ed481e813810a9b7bdc65f31a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,31,141,191,242,243,154,78,212,129,232,19,129,10,155,123,220,101,243,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
