As the chaos spreads, the Lanes escape the city in a stolen RV and arrive at Newark, New Jersey. After stocking up on asthma medicine for Rachel at a chaotic supermarket pharmacy, they take refuge in an apartment unit, home to another couple with a young boy named Tommy. Deputy Secretary-General Thierry Umutoni (Fana Mokoena)Ã¢â‚¬â€an old friend of Gerry'sÃ¢â‚¬â€calls and tells the family that he is sending a helicopter to rescue them.\nThe helicopter extracts the Lanes and Tommy (who followed them after he escaped his infected parents) from the building to a fleet of U.S. Navy vessels off the coast of New York City, where scientists and military personnel analyze the scope of the worldwide outbreaks. A virologist, Dr. Andrew Fassbach (Elyes Gabel), argues that the plague is a virus, whose origin must be found in order for a vaccine to be developed. Because of his expertise as a former UN investigator, Gerry is tasked with helping Fassbach find the outbreak's source. After being given the ultimatum of either assisting the investigation or having him and his family removed from the vessel, Gerry reluctantly agrees to help and is sent to Camp Humphreys, a military base in South Korea.\nMoments after arriving at the base, Gerry's team is attacked by zombies. An armed Fassbach panics and accidentally shoots himself dead. After being rescued by the base's surviving personnel led by Captain Speke (James Badge Dale), Gerry learns that the zombies are attracted to noise and the only way to stop them is to shoot them in their heads. A former CIA operative (David Morse) is a surviving prisoner at the base, tells Gerry to go to Jerusalem, where the Israeli Mossad have established a safe zone just before the outbreak was officially acknowledged, implying Israel might have had prior knowledge of what was to come. As Gerry and his team bike stealthily to the plane, Karin calls him through his satellite phone, activating a loud ringtone that attracts the zombies. The zombies attack and kill several of the soldiers, including Captain Speke, who commits suicide to prevent himself from turning, while they cover Gerry and his pilot during the escape.\nIn Jerusalem, Gerry meets Director of Mossad Jurgen Warmbrunn (Ludi Boeken), who explains that the Mossad had months earlier intercepted communications from an army general in India, who stated that Indian troops were fighting the &quot;rakshasa,&quot; or &quot;dead spirits.&quot; With this knowledge, the city quarantined itself. Jurgen then takes Gerry to the gates of the walls that were built by the Israelis after quarantining the city. The Israelis are allowing any survivors in to seek refuge inside the city. However, after hearing the loud singing and celebrations of the refugees within, the thousands of zombies outside begin forming massive piles like army ants, running and climbing over one another in an attempt to climb over the wall. Eventually, the zombies succeed in breaching the wall, and panic erupts everywhere as the infection spreads, with the military soon being overwhelmed. Jurgen orders Gerry's escorts to accompany him to his airplane. During their escape, Gerry notices that an old man and an emaciated boy were ignored by the zombies. While fighting the horde, Gerry's escort, an Israeli soldier who identifies herself only as &quot;Segen&quot; (Daniella Kertesz), is bitten by a zombie. Gerry quickly amputates her hand to stop the spread of the infection. Gerry and Segen are eventually forced to escape Israel on an airliner when Gerry's pilot panics and flies away as the city population was left for dead.\nContacting Thierry, the pilots are diverted and set course for a WHO research facility in Cardiff, Wales. While in the air, a stowaway zombie escapes into the main cabin and attacks the passengers. The plane crashes after Gerry detonates a grenade to blow out all the zombies, the damage causing the pilots to lose control. Segen and Gerry proceed on foot as the only apparent survivors, although Gerry is critically injured after being impaled by aircraft debris in the crash. He loses consciousness upon arrival at the facility.\nThree days later, Gerry awakens inside the main building of the facility and meets with the surviving staff. Gerry reveals a theory he has, based on the fact that the old man and the sickly boy were ignored: the infected do not bite people who are seriously injured or already terminally ill, since they would be unsuitable hosts for viral reproduction. He volunteers to inject himself with a terminal but curable pathogen to prove if his theory works. However, the wing of the building in which the pathogens are stored was overrun by zombies after a doctor accidentally infected himself. Gerry decides to go get a pathogen regardless, while Segen and the lead WHO doctor accompany him for backup. They fight their way through the zombies, and although Gerry is separated from Segen and the doctor (who were forced to return to the main building), he reaches the pathogen vault. After getting cornered inside the vault by a lone zombie, Gerry's only course of action is to perform an impromptu test of his theory. He injects himself and opens the vault doorÃ¢â‚¬â€ the zombie ignores him and later the entire horde runs past him. After he makes it back to the safe main building, everyone rejoices at his theory's success, and they restock their supplies and journey to an extraction point.\nGerry returns to his family (who have adopted Tommy), now relocated off the ship and to a safe zone in Freeport, Nova Scotia. A &quot;vaccine&quot; derived from deadly pathogens is developed that acts as camouflage for the troops battling the infected, and fleeing survivors can now cross zombie-infested areas with ease to quarantine zones. Human offensives begin against the zombies, and hope is restored. Gerry comments, &quot;This isn't the end. Not even close.&quot;\n\n&quot;Be prepared for anything, our war has just begone.&quot;\n\nEnjoy !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3511fdb4650d237f6f19063c83bd7a072bb42683","amp;dn":"World+War+Z+2013.Unrated.1080p.BluRay.x264+.+NVEE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3511fdb4650d237f6f19063c83bd7a072bb42683","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,17,253,180,101,13,35,127,111,25,6,60,131,189,122,7,43,180,38,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
