They are in the same torrent and they are at good quality!\n\n3OH!3 (pronounced &quot;three-oh-three&quot;) is an electro hop group from Boulder, Colorado formed in 2004 named after the 303 area code,[1] which includes Boulder as well as the Denver metropolitan area.[2]. The band is best known for their hit single &quot;Don't Trust Me&quot;, which reached #7 on the Billboard Hot 100. Their second single, &quot;Starstrukk&quot; featuring Katy Perry, was a top 10 hit in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Finland and Australia.\n\n3OH!3 consists of Sean Foreman, born August 27 1985 (age 24)[3] and Nathaniel Motte, born January 13, 1985 (age 25)[4], both of whom are natives of Boulder, Colorado.[5] The pair met in a physics class while attending the University of Colorado.\n3OH!3 is also known for their hand sign, referenced in their song &quot;Holler 'til You Pass Out&quot;, performed by touching two thumbs and forefingers. This is frequently seen at concerts, and their album art of 3OH!3 (album) is the hand sign.\n\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nFUDGESOCIETY NOTE\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nI'm personally not a fan of Live albums, and greatest hits. Because it's honestly redundant. Why have more than what you need unless you're a die hard fan. And if you're a die hard fan of a band, you wouldn't be torrenting their music. You would be supporting and buying, which I still support for every band album I upload. I promote torrenting, seeing if the band is good, then going out and buying the album. In no way do I promote the soul use of my torrents without intent to buy the album. Don't ruin the internet for us, these torrents are just a way to see how a band sounds, and find any missing tracks that you might not have.\n\nThank you and please seed. The support of my torrents, will greatly increase the amount of uploading I do. More seeds, more torrents, more smileys! :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bce7ad809293ddd838a27230c4fb1d6e8716359e","amp;dn":"3OH%213+%2ASTUDIO%2A+DISCOGRAPHY+%5BFUDGESOCIETY%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bce7ad809293ddd838a27230c4fb1d6e8716359e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,231,173,128,146,147,221,216,56,162,114,48,196,251,29,110,135,22,53,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
