She is taken to a boarding school where she is forced to adopt Western Euro-centric ways and learn English, often under brutal treatment. Only one sympathetic white teacher who is more and more repelled by this bigotry offers her any help from among the staff. That, with her force of will, Ashtecome (forced to take the name Amelia) is determined to hold on to her identity and that of her siblings, who were also abducted.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103244/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103244/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:845d54a923f0004e678297d4710847834a2668ea","amp;dn":"Where+the+Spirit+Lives+%281989%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"845d54a923f0004e678297d4710847834a2668ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,93,84,169,35,240,0,78,103,130,151,212,113,8,71,131,74,38,104,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
