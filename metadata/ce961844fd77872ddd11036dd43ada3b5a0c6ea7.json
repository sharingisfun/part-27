The tools I've included make the game easier to get into, but avoid changing any of the fundamentals - there are no mods here.  Dwarf Fortress can be confusing enough to play, but doesn't need to be hard to set up too.\n\nChangelog:\n - updated launcher to v19.1; it can now notify you when an updated pack is available (you can of course disable this the first time it does so, or set a reminder)\n - removed symlinks script; it seems to be responsible for some problems and isn't that important\n - removed user blueprints folder; use the UGC folder or your own system\n - modified embark profiles:  now split into four thematic files in &quot;/LNP/useful/Embark Profiles/&quot;\n - new &quot;default_profiles&quot; set for DF2014 installed by default, others can be manually added\n - fixed soundsense config for 40_04\n - updated Dwarf Therapist to v23.1; misc fixes and tweaks\n - updated Mayday graphics for 40_04\n - completed and added data-copying script; it can pull from any starter pack or vanilla DF since 40_03","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce961844fd77872ddd11036dd43ada3b5a0c6ea7","amp;dn":"Dwarf+Fortress+40_04+Starter+Pack+r2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce961844fd77872ddd11036dd43ada3b5a0c6ea7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,150,24,68,253,119,135,45,221,17,3,109,212,58,218,59,90,12,110,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
